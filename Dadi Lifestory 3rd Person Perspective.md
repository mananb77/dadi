# **Dadi's Life Story: A Journey of Strength, Service, and Spirit**

*A narrative account compiled from video interview, January 2023*

---

## **The Beginning: A Child of the Railways**

In the Delhi of the early 1940s, in a time when India still lived under British rule, a daughter was born to Shri Ram Bhargava and his wife Narayani. She was the seventh child in a family that would eventually number eleven children—four brothers and three sisters surrounded her in the bustling household. Her father, born in 1901, served as a Senior Mail Rail Guard, a position of some importance in the Indian Railways. He was the kind of man who hoisted the flag at the railway station, a duty that spoke to his standing in the community.

The family lived in a large railway bungalow behind the station, provided by the government as part of her father's employment. "बड़ा बंगला था जिसमें तीन चार कमरे थे," she remembers—it was a big bungalow with three or four rooms. But this was the India of the 1940s and early 1950s, and even a railway officer's home lacked many basic amenities. The bathroom and toilet stood outside the main house, and in those early years, there was no electricity at all.

Instead, every evening brought the ritual of lighting lamps and lanterns. She can still describe the meticulous process: "हमारे घर के लोग लैंप की जो चिमनिया होती थी या लैंप की चिमनिया होती थी उन्हें राख से साफ करते थे कपड़े से पोंछते थे और फिर उनको तैयार करते थे शाम के लिए।" The family would clean the lamp chimneys with ash, wipe them with cloth, and prepare them for the evening. These lamps would burn through the night, their flickering light the only illumination in the darkness.

The servant quarters on the compound housed a teacher and a washerwoman who helped with the daily work. Beyond the house stretched extensive fencing and a large yard where her brothers tended a garden. "लॉन था बड़े-बड़े कमरे थे," she recalls—there was a lawn, and hedges all around. It was a life of relative comfort, but one that required constant effort to maintain.

## **The Water Challenge: Lessons in Resourcefulness**

Perhaps nothing captures the reality of those early years better than the daily struggle for water. With no running water in the house, the family hired a man whose sole job was carrying water. "वो अपने कंधों पर एक लकड़ी की बैंगी जिसे बोलते थे वो बनी रहती थी," she explains. He carried a wooden pole across his shoulders, with thick iron wires hanging down. From these wires hung hooks, and on the hooks, canisters—cut ghee or oil containers, each holding sixteen liters of water.

The man would make his journey four times a day, bringing two canisters per trip. "तो दो एक बार में दो दो कैनस्टर पानी लाया करता था 32 लीटर्स," she notes—thirty-two liters at a time. Their family ordered four trips daily, bringing approximately 128 liters of water to sustain the household.

But even this wasn't always enough. The family maintained high standards of cleanliness, and with brothers tending an extensive garden and plants everywhere, water needs constantly exceeded supply. When this happened, the children took matters into their own hands. "हम खुद नल पर गए और 100 मीटर दूर पर नल था वहां से भर भर के बाल्टियां हम बच्चे से ले आते थे," she remembers. They would walk 100 meters to the public tap, fill buckets, and carry them back themselves. Even as children, they learned that when something needs doing, you do it yourself.

For bathing, the family improvised a system in the veranda. "बरांडे में और वहीं पर पर्दा डाल के हम लोग एक अलग ही नहा लेते थे," she says. They hung a curtain behind an iron grill, creating a private space with a drain so water would flow out properly. It was simple, functional, and required no complaint—just acceptance of reality and creative problem-solving.

## **The Walk to School: Building a Steel Body**

Education meant walking. Every day, she and her siblings would walk about one and a half kilometers to the railway school, carrying their cloth bags—"थैलियों के बस्ते होते थे जैसे थैला होता है वैसा बस्ता होता था"—simple sacks made of cloth that they filled with their school materials and slung over their shoulders.

The railway school offered certain privileges. "दूध भी मिलता था वहां पे क्योंकि रेलवे का था," she notes—they received milk at school because it was a railway institution. The fees, though nominal, were deducted directly from her father's salary over two-month periods, along with all other household expenses. Only after everything was deducted would her father receive his remaining pay.

At school, they addressed their teachers with deep respect. "पहले मास्टर बोलते थे भैया जी बोलते थे तो हम मास्टर साहब से पढ़ते थे," she remembers. The masters taught them well, giving proper lectures, but some of the most valuable lessons came from unexpected sources.

One day stands out in her memory even now, more than seventy years later. The school invited a sadhu, a holy man, to teach the children about health. "वो एक बार मुझे अभी भी याद है और मैं अभी भी करती हूं," she says with emphasis—she still remembers it and still does it. The sadhu taught them to fill their mouths with water and splash it repeatedly over their eyes and face. "उससे मेरी आंखें बिल्कुल ठीक है," she states firmly. At eighty-one years old, her eyesight remains excellent. The surgeon who examined her commented on how healthy her nerves are. This childhood teaching became a lifelong practice, and the proof, she says, is in her eyes.

Another practice shaped her physical health for life: eating sugarcane. "गन्ने को छीला और छीलने के बाद मुंह से गंडेरिया चूसा करते थे तो मेरे दांत बहुत मजबूत है," she explains. They would peel sugarcane and chew it thoroughly to extract the juice, and her teeth became remarkably strong as a result. Even now, dentists comment with surprise on the strength of her teeth at eighty years old. This wasn't just an occasional treat—after marriage, she would buy sugarcane by the "man" (approximately forty kilograms), sit on the roof terrace, and spend time breaking it at the joints, peeling it, and chewing the sweet inner fiber. "यह गन्ने खाने का काम तो शादी के बाद भी चलता रहा," she confirms—the practice continued well into her married life.

Between the daily walks, the physical activities, and the wholesome nutrition, she built what she calls a "steel body." "मतलब सॉलिड बॉडी बना ली थी," she says with satisfaction. Later, when she arrived at her in-laws' house after marriage, she would tell them: "स्टैंड और स्टील की बॉडी बनाई बना के दी है"—they've built and given me a body of steel. "कितना भी काम कर लो अपन को कोई बीमारी नहीं कुछ नहीं," she declares. Any amount of work, and no illness befalls her.

## **The Family Crisis: Fighting for Education**

The year 1955 brought significant change. Her father retired from railway service after decades of dedication. But retirement in those days didn't bring the security it might today. "उनको पेंशन नहीं थी। पीएफ मिला था," she explains—there was no pension, only the Provident Fund, a lump sum payment. And he faced enormous responsibilities: five weddings to arrange, including hers, for his children.

This financial pressure created an immediate conflict with her educational aspirations. Moving back to their family home in Delhi—"152 कटरा मशरूम, दरीबा कलान, दिल्ली," a massive house with twenty-two to twenty-four rooms arranged around a central courtyard—should have meant opportunity. Her grandfather had purchased this ancestral home some eighty-six years before her birth. But in 1956, at age sixteen, she found herself fighting for something many families didn't consider essential: continued education for a daughter.

"हम तो पढ़ेंगे," she insisted firmly—I will study. The resistance wasn't merely about money. Girls' education wasn't always encouraged in those times. Society had different expectations. But she refused to accept this limitation. "हमने पढ़ाई का आगे रखा कि हम तो पढ़ेंगे उसके लिए हमें थोड़ा सा स्ट्रगल करना पड़ा," she acknowledges—she had to struggle for this, especially for college education. Her father wasn't ready, the family hesitated, but she stood firm.

Eventually, her father—this man born in 1901, her great-great-grandfather in the family tree—gave his permission. "ही गव हर परमिशन," she says. This was progressive thinking for that era, and she has never forgotten that he ultimately supported her dreams. To manage finances, the family arranged two weddings in 1957 and 1959\. Her own marriage would wait until 1967, when she was twenty-seven—extraordinarily late for those times, but it allowed her to complete her education.

## **Delhi Days: The Daily Journey to Knowledge**

Getting into high school required help. Her eldest brother's wife, a Delhi native familiar with the school system, became her advocate. They first tried the Government school near Jama Masjid. "जमा मस्जिद के गवर्नमेंट स्कूल था। वहां हो गई थी। हमें जगह नहीं मिली," she recalls—no space available. Government schools were more common then, private schools fewer, but this meant admission could be competitive.

Her sister-in-law tried again, this time at a Government Girls' School in the Rajghat area, not far from where Gandhi Ji's memorial stands. "राजघाट के वहां एक गवर्नमेंट गर्ल्स स्कूल है। उसमें हमारी भाभी ने एडमिशन दिलाया प्रिंसिपल से," she remembers. The principal agreed, and she was enrolled at what would officially be called Government Girls Higher Secondary School, Dariyaganj.

The school lay approximately four to five kilometers from her home in Dariba Kalan. "हमारे घर से करीब राजघाट चार पांच किलोमीटर तो हो ही गई," she notes. For one brief month, she experienced the luxury of bus transportation. A bus service was arranged specifically for the girls—students and daughters of jewelers, filling the vehicle completely. The cost was remarkably modest: "₹1 लेती थी उस समय बस किराया जाने का और आने का"—one rupee for the entire month, for both going and coming.

But after just one month, "बस और हम लोग पैदल जाया करते थे," she says—the bus stopped and they walked. Every single day, for years, she walked the route: from Dariba Kalan to Parade Ground, then to Dariyaganj, past Ghanta Masjid, to her school near Rajghat. "हमें आधा घंटा लगता था," she recalls—thirty minutes each way. This wasn't seen as a hardship. It was simply what one did. The walk built strength, discipline, and determination.

During these years, from ninth through eleventh standard, her mind stayed focused on studies. "बस पढ़ाई में ही दिमाग रहता था," she emphasizes. But she wasn't merely bookish. Her spiritual side flourished too. During ninth and eleventh standards, she wrote the Gayatri Mantra thousands of times—first 2,500, then 5,000 repetitions. "ढाई हजार का मेरे पास अभी भी कागज है कि मैंने सन 60 में मथुरा तपोभूमि और ढाई हजार मंत्र भेजे," she says. She still possesses the certificate from 1960 showing she sent 2,500 mantras to Mathura Tapobhoomi as a spiritual offering.

"मैं आदर्शवादी थी। मेरी दादी को मैं पढ़ के सुनाती थी कृष्ण लीला और रामायण," she remembers. She was idealistic, spiritually inclined. Her grandmother couldn't read, so she would read aloud the Krishna Leela and Ramayana to her—an act of service and devotion combined.

## **College: Breaking Barriers**

When the time came for college, she faced an ironic situation. Her academic record in eleventh standard showed distinction marks in Lower Mathematics and Domestic Science, good marks in English and Hindi, but only sixty percent in Economics—her weakest subject. "Economics मेरे कम नंबर थे," she admits frankly.

Yet Economics was exactly where she ended up, thanks to her third brother. "मेरे चार भाई थे," she explains—she had four brothers, and the third one had studied at Ramjas College in Maurice Nagar, Delhi. He had completed BA Honours in Economics there and knew the Head of Department, N. Agarwal. "उन्होंने मेरे को वहां एडमिशन दिलाया और Economics में ढलाया जिसमें की मेरे सबसे कम नंबर आए थे," she says with a laugh—they got her admission and "pushed" her into Economics despite it being her weakest subject.

The irony didn't defeat her. She studied at Ramjas College for three years, from 1961 to 1964, completing her BA Honours. "मैं वहां तीन साल पढ़ी," she confirms. The teaching was entirely in English, exams in English, and she took membership at the nearby Delhi School of Economics library. There she read the English economic writers—Bentham, Malthus, and others—making notes in English, absorbing theories of development that would shape her worldview for life.

"हमने यू एस ए का डेवलपमेंट रशिया का जापान का इंग्लैंड का सारे डेवलपमेंट पढ़े थे," she reflects. She studied the development of the USA, Russia, Japan, and England. Meanwhile, "अपना India जो था डेवलपिंग कंट्री था"—India was a developing country, "रिच इन रिसोर्सेज एंड इनहैबिटेड बाय पुअर्स"—rich in resources but inhabited by poor people. The question that formed in her mind would guide her entire life: "कैसे अपने को आगे बढ़ाएं बच्चों को कैसे बढ़ाएं"—how to advance ourselves, how to advance our children.

Her commute to Ramjas involved walking from Dariba Kalan to Splendid Road, then to Cycle Market, reaching Lal Qila where special buses ran during college hours—9 to 10 AM—carrying students to Maurice Nagar. "पूरे भर के बस जाती थी," she remembers—the bus would be completely full, stopping at Kamala Nehru College and Indraprastha College before reaching Ramjas.

In her class of about twenty-two students, only four were girls. "हम चार चार लड़कियां थे कॉलेज में क्लास के अंदर और बाकी लड़के थे," she notes. "लड़कियां ही आपस में मस्ती करते थे बस," she says—the girls had fun among themselves. When she needed to discuss notes or ask questions about coursework, she would speak with the boys, but her main connections were with fellow female students. "मैं सब ग्रुप लीडर रहती थी," she states proudly—she was always the group leader. The girls didn't fear anything when she was around, though she herself remained appropriately cautious around boys.

## **NCC: Learning "Do or Die"**

College brought an experience that would mark her permanently: the National Cadet Corps. For three years—first year, second year, and third year—she participated in NCC training. "फर्स्ट ईयर सेकंड ईयर थर्ड ईयर NCC थी," she confirms.

The standard training involved wearing a uniform—NCC pants and shirt with a cap—and drilling for an hour daily. "एक घंटा NCC करते थे मार्च पास करते थे," she recalls. They learned to march in formation, received 10 grams of butter and a roll each session, and practiced coordinated movements with various implements including a musical stick—a wooden rod with chains and bells that would chime as they maneuvered it. "मैं ग्रुप लीडर हुआ करती थी उसमें सबको सिखाती थी," she notes—she was group leader for this too, teaching everyone the movements.

But everything changed after 1962\. "जब China की लड़ाई हुई 62 में तो 63 में हमको उन्होंने rifle training दी," she explains. The India-China war brought a new intensity to their training. In her third year, they learned actual rifle handling. "कंधे पर rifle को रख के इधर सीधे कंधे पे और निशाना लगाना कि कहां जाएगा," she describes—how to hold the rifle on the shoulder, how to take aim, where the bullet would go. "शी टू फायर रियल rifle," she confirms emphatically—she actually fired real rifles.

The practical application never came. "पर उसका कोई उपयोग नहीं हुआ। बस हम सीख के रह गए," she admits—they learned but never used it in actual service. Yet something more important stayed with her. "पर जो एक मेन बात हम वहां सीखे 'डू एंड डाई' वो अभी भी चल रही है हमारे दिमाग में," she declares with feeling. The main lesson learned there—"Do or Die"—still runs in her mind today. That spirit of determination, of never giving up, of being willing to sacrifice everything for what matters—this became part of her character.

She also played sports. "थ्रोबॉल खेलते थे," she says, describing what was essentially baseball—someone throws the ball, you hit it with a bat, it goes far, and while fielders retrieve it, you run touching flags or bases before returning to your position. "थ्रोबॉल इज नथिंग बट बेसबॉल," she confirms with a smile. "शी प्लेड बेसबॉल," as her grandson summarizes. Between the physical training, the rifle practice, the marching drills, the sports, and the daily walking, she built extraordinary physical strength.

## **The Journey Continues: Marriage and Teaching**

By 1967, she had completed her MA First Year from Meerut University. When Meerut and Agra Universities separated, she completed her MA Final Year through Agra University privately, traveling to Delhi to give exams. Her degree came from Agra University in 1968\. That same year, newly married at the late age of twenty-seven, she took her first teaching position.

From July to December 1968, while pregnant with her first son, she taught mathematics to eighth standard students. "अर्थमेटिक ज्योमेट्री और अलजेब्रा तीनों सब्जेक्ट पढ़ाती थी," she lists—arithmetic, geometry, and algebra, all three subjects. Her teaching method was remarkable: "बिना देखे कुछ किताब खोली और पढ़ा दिया। कभी मैं पढ़ के नहीं पढ़ती थी," she emphasizes. She never opened the book to teach, never read and then taught—just taught directly from her understanding. "मेरा मैथ बहुत अच्छा था," she states simply. Her mathematics was very strong. She still possesses the certificate stating she taught excellently.

But the salary was modest—fifteen rupees per month. "पैसे बहुत कम देते मुझे," she thought—too little money for the hard work. Others with B.Ed. degrees earned more, so she decided to get the qualification herself.

The B.Ed. course in 1970-71 presented challenges. She had to manage four different locations: a Parai school, a college, a hostel where she sometimes stayed overnight, and her home where her small son waited. "एक दिन जिद कर ली इन्होंने कि मम्मी को लेके ही जाऊंगा मैं," she remembers with a laugh. One day her son insisted at the hostel: I will take Mummy with me, I won't leave without her. The warden finally said, "तुम घर जाओ बच्चा तुम्हारा साथ जाएगा"—you go home, the child will go with you. Sometimes he stayed with her sister (his Mausi) while she completed her training.

After B.Ed., her salary jumped to fifty rupees. "B.Ed. वालों को ज्यादा दे रहे हैं तो मैंने फिर B.Ed. किया," she explains pragmatically—they were paying B.Ed. holders more, so she got the B.Ed. The practical value of education was clear to her, not just the theoretical knowledge but its concrete impact on life.

## **Following the Bank: A Nomadic Decade**

Her husband's career with Union Bank of India shaped their next decade. He progressed steadily—clerk to supervisor to special assistant to officer to manager—and with each promotion came transfers. "इसके पापा manager हो गए थे मतलब manager थे," she notes—he became a manager, a high position that brought bank housing wherever they went.

Jodhpur came first, from 1967 to 1973\. They lived in Shivniwas on Sardarpur B Road, a bank bungalow. "बंगला था वहां भी," she confirms. Their first son was born there in February 1969, their second in 1973\. "तो पापा जोधपुर में पैदा हुए थे," she says of the eldest. "चाचा भी जोधपुर में हुए थे बनू चाचा," she adds of the second.

Those six years in Jodhpur meant "बस तीनों बच्चों की बच्चों को"—just serving the children, raising them, managing the household. Her focus was complete: their development, their needs, their future.

Kota followed from 1973 to 1975\. "Shopping Center में रहते थे मुफ्तलाल की दुकान है नीचे और ऊपर हमारा मकान था," she describes—they lived above Muftlal's shop in the shopping center. Their third son was born there in 1974\. The house was walking distance from St. Paul's School where the boys studied.

Then Ajmer for less than a year in 1975-76. "छह महीने साल ऐसे ही रहे," she estimates—six months to a year. They lived near Raja Cycle and Martin Bridge in a bungalow with a courtyard, a Sanjina tree, and large airy rooms. "बड़ा घर था हमारा," she notes—it was a big house. But the stay was brief, another transfer already pending.

Udaipur claimed them from 1976 to 1981, a full five years. "पांच साल रहे उदयपुर में," she confirms. They lived first on Residency Road, then moved to Bhatt Ji Ki Badi, both in the same general area near Bhopalpur. The lakes—Pichola, Swaroop Sagar, Fateh Sagar—lay just a few kilometers away. All three sons attended St. Paul's School in Bhopalpur.

Through all these moves, her purpose remained constant. "मेरे तो कैसे अपने को आगे बढ़ाएं बच्चों को कैसे बढ़ाएं यही था," she reflects—how to advance ourselves, how to advance the children, this was always on her mind. The Economics education had shaped her thinking. She had studied how developed countries grew. "यह दिमाग में था बस," she emphasizes—this stayed in her mind.

## **The Jaipur Years Begin: Finding Home**

1981 brought them to Jaipur, and Jaipur would become home. "जयपुर 81 में आए जयपुर," she states. They came when her eldest son was in seventh standard, the middle one in third, and the youngest in first. "जब ये नहीं चाहता मकान मालिक तो मैं क्यों रहूं," she declares—if the landlord doesn't want us, why should I stay?

Initially they lived behind Khasa Kothi, near the railway station and Gangaur Hotel. But the landlord wanted them out. The house belonged to someone named Lumba or Dumba, taken by the bank. "मैंने कहा मैं ऐसे मकान में नहीं रहूंगी। दूसरा लेलो," she insisted—I won't live in such a house. Take another one. "हमने फिर अपना खाली कराया पैसे दे के यह वाला मकान का हम इसमें आ गए," she explains. They paid to vacate the current residents from their chosen house and moved in.

That was 1981\. "अब तक अभी 42 इयर्स 42 सालों में यहां," she says. Forty-two years in the same house as of 2023\. "सितंबर अक्टूबर में आ गए थे यहां पे या दिसंबर मतलब एंड में आए थे इस साल के," she tries to recall—September-October or December, the end of the year 1981\. The exact month has blurred, but the fact remains: this became their permanent home.

## **The Choice: Career or Family**

Once settled in Jaipur, she made a conscious decision about her life's work. The principal of Seedling School, a higher secondary school, approached her: "तुम हमारे घर हमारे स्कूल में पढ़ाने आ जाओ"—come teach at our school. "मैंने कहा मैं नहीं आ सकती। तुम ने घर में थी," she responded—I can't come, I had children at home.

Instead, she taught privately. "तो मैंने बैच में पढ़ाती थी टेबल पर बैठ के," she explains—she taught in batches, sitting at the table at home. "मेरे हाथ के बच्चे बहुत अच्छे निकले," she says with satisfaction. Children taught by her turned out very well. They passed their exams. "उनकी मां अभी तक मेरे से मिलती है," she notes—their mothers still meet her today, grateful for the education their children received.

Her reasoning for not working outside was clear and practical. "मैं सोचती थी अगर नौकरी करती तो दो काम करने पड़ते," she explains. If she took a job, she would have to do two works—the job and household work. "अब एक ही काम करना पड़ रहा है सर बस घर का काम करो," she continues—now only one work needs doing: household work.

She accepted the trade-offs frankly. "नहीं हुआ डेवलपमेंट कोई बात नहीं," she acknowledges—if development doesn't happen in other areas, no problem. "हॉबीज पूरी नहीं हुई," she admits—hobbies couldn't all be fulfilled. "जो एक जिस चीज़ के लिए स्ट्रगल किया कि यह करूंगी वो नहीं कर पाई," she says—what she struggled to achieve, she couldn't fully do. "यह सब किस्मत है मेरी," she concludes—this is all my fate.

But her choice was deliberate. She had a vision shaped by her Economics education. "भाई मेरे तीन बच्चे हैं चौथे पति है पांचवी में हूं," she explains her philosophy. Three children, fourth is husband, fifth is herself. "इन्हीं का काम जो है वो मेरे लिए वर्क है," she declares. Their work is my work. "वही वर्क इज़ वरशिप है," she emphasizes—that work IS worship. "यह सब भगवान के जीव हैं," she continues—these are all God's beings. Serving them is serving God.

Moreover, she wasn't just raising three sons. "शुरू से मैं इनके बहन भाई में रही हूं," she notes—from the beginning, she lived among her husband's siblings. After just one year alone setting up the house, "इनकी दो बहनें और एक भाई मतलब इनकी तुम्हारे पापा की बुआ दो बुआ एक चाचा आ गए," she explains—his two sisters and one brother came to live with them. "तो उनके पांच आदमियों का काम हो गया," she states—five people's work became her responsibility.

"हमारे बाबा के चाचा और बुआओं की शादी और सबकी पढ़ाइयां और सबकी नौकरियां मैंने उनमें सहयोग किया है," she details—their weddings, their education, their jobs, she helped with all of it. "कभी मना नहीं किया कि नहीं करूंगी मैं यह काम," she insists—never refused saying I won't do this work. "मैं कहती हूं जो पुण्य का काम हो रहा है मैं पाप की भागी क्यों बनूं मना करके?" she asks rhetorically—if virtuous work is happening, why become party to sin by refusing? "करो भाई हम आ रही हूं," she would say—do it, brother, I'm coming to help.

Her own educational degrees remained, unused in the professional sense. "लेके वो डिग्रियों का अपना," she acknowledges—despite having all those degrees. But she has no regrets about choosing family service over career advancement.

## **A Lifetime of Learning: Never Stop Growing**

What makes her story remarkable isn't just what she accomplished early in life, but that she never stopped learning. Even while raising children and managing a household that often included extended family, she pursued course after course, skill after skill.

In 1978, while still in Udaipur, she took a food preservation course. "टॉफी बनानी, जेली बनानी, जैम बनाना, कैंडी बनानी, स्क्वैशेस और सिरप्स यह सब सीखा," she lists—toffees, jellies, jams, candies, squashes, and syrups, she learned them all.

The moment they arrived in Jaipur in 1981, she enrolled in a cookery and bakery course at Khasa Kothi. "Government of India चलाती थी तब मैंने किया," she notes—the Government of India ran it. "एक महीने का कोर्स था। अल्टरनेट डेज़ पे क्लास होती थी," she explains—one month, alternate days. "पिज़्ज़ा है, केक है," she adds—pizza, cakes, all bakery items.

In 1987, six years after settling in Jaipur, she took a six-month cutting and tailoring course. "कपड़ों का काटना और सी काट के सिलना उसको," she defines it—cutting cloth and sewing what you've cut. The course was comprehensive: "जांगिया सिलना, बनियाने सिलनी। फिर उसके बाद फ्रॉक वगैरह बनाने, ब्लाउज बनाने, सलवार कमीज़ बनाने, नाइट सूट बनाने, पेंट बनाने, कमीज़ बनानी बच्चों की," she enumerates—underwear, vests, frocks, blouses, salwar kameez, nightsuits, pants, children's shirts—everything.

She joined the Kitchen Gardening Association on Tank Road. "कई प्राइस दिए उसने," she says—won several prizes for her gardening work. Her nephew now runs the small gardening center.

Around 1987, she and her husband both took astrology courses. "तेरे दादा करने लगे तो मैंने भी उनके साथ-साथ ज्योतिष का कोर्स कर लिया," she explains—when your grandfather started learning, I also did the astrology course with him. The year is somewhat unclear in her memory—"अब मेरे सर्टिफिकेट देखूं तो मैं एग्ज़ैक्ट ईयर भी बता सकता हूं," she notes—if she looked at the certificates, she could give the exact year. But she later confirms it was 2001, in Chennai. "काफी साल हो गए उन बातों को," she reflects—many years have passed since then.

Her music education, begun in 1954 with tabla and harmonium, continued intermittently. She gave the second year exam from Allahabad University, bought the third year book, but stopped when her young brother-in-law died at forty-one. "तो मैंने छोड़ दिया कि लोग कहेंगे लहंगा वाना बजाती है यह तो जवान देवर मरा है," she explains—people would say she's playing music when her young brother-in-law has died. Social propriety in mourning demanded she stop. "इसलिए मैंने खुद ने ही छोड़ दिया," she emphasizes—I myself stopped, by my own choice.

Even first aid training came early, in 1959 in Delhi, from St. Ambulance. She later taught food preservation herself for a month at Maharaja School, passing on what she had learned to others.

Her daughter-in-law Kokila compiled all these certificates into one collection, making it easy to reference a lifetime of learning. Every few years, a new skill, a new qualification, a new capability. At age sixty-one, she completed the astrology course. This is a woman who never stopped growing, never stopped adding to her knowledge and abilities.

## **Teaching Values: The Three Core Principles**

Yet of all the education she received, the most fundamental came from her mother. "मेरी मां कहती थी मतलब इनकी नानी," she explains—my mother used to say, meaning their grandmother. Three principles, simple and clear:

"चोरी मत करो"—Don't steal. "झूठ मत बोलो"—Don't lie. "किसी की जी मत जीभ को मत दुखाओ"—Don't hurt anyone with your tongue.

"यही भगवान की सेवा है," her mother concluded—this itself is serving God. "और वही धर्म मैंने पालन किया," she states—and this same dharma I followed. These weren't abstract principles but practical guidelines lived every day.

She passed them to her children with equal firmness. Teaching them to share was lesson one. "जैसे अंगूर लाए इनको चार तीनों को बांट दिए," she illustrates—like grapes, she would distribute to all three sons. "और कहा बेटा मुझे दो थोड़े से मैं भी तो खाऊंगी," she would add—son, give me a couple too, I also want to eat. "तो यह इनको बच्चों को यह आ गया कि भाई हमें यह चीज़ लेके बांट के खानी है," she explains—so this entered the children's minds: we must share what we get. The rule was absolute: "कोई भी चीज़ खाओ तो बांट के खाओ"—whatever you eat, eat by sharing.

On honesty, she was equally unwavering. "फिर इनको सिखाया कि किसी की चीज़ चोरी नहीं करके लेनी है," she taught—don't take anyone's thing by stealing. If they found something lying around: "तो वो भगवान की मंदिर में दे दो"—give it to the temple. If something of unclear provenance came to them: "तो अपने पास मत रखो इस चीज़ को मत लो"—don't keep that thing, don't take it. The right way was clear: "अपनी मेहनत से करो"—earn by your own hard work.

She enforced this strictly. "कभी पेंसिल भी लिया है तो मैंने कहा वापस दे के आओ," she recalls—even if they took a pencil by mistake, I said return it immediately. "नहीं मैं दे के आऊंगी स्कूल में," she would threaten—if you don't, I'll go to school and return it myself. The result: "तो यह कभी कोई चीज़ वापस लाते नहीं थे किसी की बच्चे इनको मतलब चोरी करना सिखाया की नहीं करोगे चोरी"—they never brought anything home belonging to others. They learned: you will not steal.

She taught by example too. Never hiring tutors, she taught all three sons herself through twelfth standard. "हमने ट्यूशन नहीं लगाई एक बार भी इनको अपने घर में," she states emphatically—never hired tuitions even once for them at our home. "और वो भी क्या था कि मैंने ही पढ़ाती थी इन बच्चों को तीनों को," she continues—and moreover, I myself taught all three children.

Her eldest, when he started giving tuitions himself in twelfth standard for IIT Chemistry preparation, had learned from her teaching. The values and the knowledge both passed from generation to generation through her dedication.

## **The Philosophy of the Four Ashrams**

As she reached her eighties, her understanding of life's structure became clearer and more important to her. "चार आश्रम होते हैं," she explains—there are four ashrams, four stages of life. She can recite them precisely:

"एक बाल आश्रम होता है"—Bal Ashram, childhood, from birth to twenty-five. "गृहस्थ आश्रम होता है"—Grihastha Ashram, householder stage, twenty-five to fifty. "एक वानप्रस्थ आश्रम होता है"—Vanprastha Ashram, retirement stage, fifty to seventy-five. "और एक सन्यास आश्रम"—And Sanyas Ashram, renunciation stage, seventy-five onward.

"तो अब मैं सन्यास आश्रम में आ गई," she declares—now I've entered the Sanyas Ashram at eighty-one. What this means shapes her entire current existence. "तो मुझे दुनिया से को छोड़ना है," she explains—I must leave worldly attachments. "मतलब धीरे-धीरे कटिंग करनी है हर चीज़ की और भगवान में लगना है," she continues—gradually cut off from everything and engage in God.

This isn't mere theory. It manifests in concrete changes. "अब ज्यादा तामझाम पसंद नहीं करती," she notes—don't like too much pomp and show now. "शादी में जाना पसंद नहीं करती," she adds—don't like going to weddings. "अकेले में रहना पसंद करती हूं," she states—prefer to stay alone. "जिस से मेरी जो रोज़ाना का काम है," she reasons—so I can focus on my daily routine.

"बस मेरा यही उद्देश्य है कि जो आश्रम मैंने गुज़ारा उसको मैं अच्छी तरह गुज़ारूं," she summarizes her goal—whatever ashram stage I'm passing through, I should pass through it properly. Looking back, she can evaluate her life by this framework.

"बाल आश्रम में बचपन की चीज़ें," she reflects—in childhood stage, did childhood things properly. "गृहस्थ आश्रम में गृहस्थ की सारी चीज़ें," she continues—in householder stage, did all household duties. "बाप में तुम्हारे पापा की शादीवादी और अपनी ज़िम्मेवारियों से निपटने का सारा काम," she details—your Papa's wedding and all responsibilities, everything completed. "जैसे तुम लोग पैदा हुए तो तुम्हारा बर्थडे मनाना बाल उतरवाना सारे काम करना," she adds—like when you all were born, celebrating birthdays, mundan ceremonies, all those things.

Now in Sanyas Ashram, her focus has shifted fundamentally. The time for social obligations has passed. The time for spiritual practice has arrived.

## **Daily Spiritual Practice: The Morning Routine**

Every morning at seven o'clock sharp, she walks to the temple. "7:00 बजे आरती होती है," she states—the aarti happens at seven. She attends not one but three aartis sequentially. "एक तो होती है शिव जी की आरती राम के 7:00 बजे," she lists—first is Shiv Ji's aarti. "दूसरी होती है ओम जय जगदीश हरे राम कृष्ण लक्ष्मण सीता हनुमान जी की और राधा गोविंद की," she continues—second is the Om Jai Jagdish Hare for Ram, Krishna, Laxman, Sita, Hanuman, and Radha Govind. "तीसरी होती है गणेश जी की," she completes—third is Ganesh Ji's aarti.

"तीनों आरती करके प्रसाद ले के वहां से मैं फिर घर आती हूं," she explains—after all three aartis, taking prasad, then I return home. "कल तुम्हारे पापा भी गए थे आरती में," she notes during the interview—yesterday your Papa also went to the aarti. Gradually, the next generation begins joining her practices.

Returning home, she faces her second major spiritual practice: writing. "रोज़ दो पेज लिखती हूं," she states—I write two pages daily. Not just any writing—she writes "जय श्री कृष्णा" repeatedly, methodically, devotionally.

Her system is precise. "छह कॉलम बने हुए हैं पेज में एक कॉलम में 37 नाम आते हैं," she explains—six columns per page, thirty-seven names per column. "छह कॉलम में 222 नाम आ जाते हैं," she calculates—222 names total per page. Since 108 names equal one mala (rosary count), "16 की दो मालाएं पूरे हो जाती है," she notes—two malas of 108 complete per page. "तो दो पेज में चार माला," she concludes—so two pages equal four malas. "रोज़ लिखना मेरा काम है," she emphasizes—writing this daily is my work.

She's already filled half a notebook. "यह कॉपी है जय श्री कृष्णा," she shows during the video call, displaying pages of neat, repetitive writing. "और इसमें मैंने आधा भर लिया यहां तक," she indicates—and in this I've filled half.

But her system includes an ingenious safeguard. "यह दो पेज एडवांस में लिख के रखूंगी," she explains—I write two pages in advance. The reasoning came from bitter experience. "तीन तारीख को मैं हॉस्पिटल गई थी," she recalls—I went to hospital on the third. "तो मेरा तीन का लिखा हुआ था," she notes with satisfaction—but my third's writing was already done. When she returned on the fifth, she wrote for the fourth and fifth. "फिर ऐसे कर कर के एडवांस कर करके अब एडवांस में पहुंच गई लिख लिख के," she continues—doing like this, advancing day by day, now I've reached several days ahead.

"और इस से मुझे बहुत अच्छी शांति मिली है," she reflects with deep feeling. From this writing, she has received very good peace. "लिख के," she emphasizes—through this writing, inner peace arrives.

Her third practice is reading. "बस गीता पढ़ती हूं," she states simply—I read Gita. The Bhagavad Gita gives her something essential. "गीता से मुझे ज्ञान मिलता है कि कैसे अपन को जीवन जीना है," she explains—Gita gives me knowledge of how to live life. "कैसे दूसरों से समझना है कि भाई यह प्राणी क्या है," she continues—how to understand others, what are these beings. "यह मतलब यह प्रकृति क्या है," she asks—what is this nature. "पेड़ पौधे पशु पक्षी इंसान क्यों बने कैसे बने भगवान ने यह सारे," she muses—trees, plants, animals, birds, humans—why did God make all these, how were they made.

Recently she's been attending Shiv Puran discourses at the temple. "24 नवम्बर से और 30 नवम्बर तक सुन चुकी," she notes—from November 24 to 30, she completed listening to one. Another series was scheduled from December 30 to January 9 during the interview. "हमारे मंदिर में शिव पुराण होगा 30 तारीख से 9 तारीख तक चलेगा," she explains—our temple will have Shiv Puran from the 30th to the 9th.

These discourses teach "सृष्टि क्या है और अपन को कैसे रहना है"—what is creation and how should we live. But she's thoughtful about application. The texts describe Satya Yuga, Treta Yuga, Dwapara Yuga, and now Kaliyuga. "वो वाली चीज़ें यहाँ फिट नहीं बैठती है," she observes astutely—those old practices don't fit here now. Times have changed. "लेकिन जहाँ तक वो उन चीज़ों का जो सार है जो उद्देश्य है जो लक्ष्य है उसको पकड़े रखो," she advises—but whatever is the essence, the purpose, the goal—hold onto THAT. "चाहे वो कलियुगी हिसाब से मतलब लो," she continues—even if you interpret according to Kaliyuga times. "लेकिन अपन को लक्ष्य पे पहुँचना है," she insists—but we must reach the goal.

## **The Philosophy of Karma and Rebirth**

Her spiritual study has given her a clear framework for understanding action and consequence. "गीता कहती है कि अगर सात्विक कर्म किए तो देव योनि मिलेगी," she explains—Gita says if you do satvik (pure) actions, you'll get divine birth. "और अगर राजस कर्म किए तो मनुष्य योनि मिलेगी," she continues—if rajasic (passionate) actions, human birth. "और अगर आपने तामसी कर्म किए तो कीट पतंगा नीची वाली योनियाँ मिलेगी," she completes—if tamasic (dark) actions, you'll become insects, moths, lower life forms.

The law of return is precise. "खुशी दोगे तो खुशी लोगे," she states—give happiness, get happiness. "अच्छा किसी का करोगे सुख दोगे तो सुख लोगे," she continues—do good for someone, give comfort, you'll receive it. "दुःख दोगे तो दुःख लोगे," she warns—give sorrow, get sorrow. "कैसी अगर गलत बातें करोगे," she elaborates—if you do wrong things.

But here's the crucial teaching: "फिर मरने के बाद यह चीज़ें 10 गुना ज्यादा होकर मिलती है," she emphasizes. After death, these things return tenfold. "जैसे एक किसी का चोर लिया तो आपको ₹10 चुकाने पड़ेंगे मरने के बाद," she illustrates—if you steal one rupee, you'll repay ten after death.

Why? Because of what accompanies you. "मन अपना शरीर नहीं जाएगा साथ में," she explains—the physical body doesn't go with you. "यह स्थूल शरीर यही रह जाएगा," she states—this gross body stays here. "सूक्ष्म शरीर जाएगा," she continues—the subtle body goes. And with it: "मन, चित्त, अंग और बुद्धि और इंद्रियों के पाँचों कर्म," she details—mind, consciousness, aspects, intellect, and the five actions of the senses. "सुनना," she gives example—hearing. "यह इंद्रियों की जो जो कर्म है वो सारे साथ जाएंगे," she concludes—all these sensory actions go with you. "जैसा कि गीता बताती है," she adds—as Gita explains.

So her reasoning is clear: "तो मैं यही सोचती हूँ क्यों अपन ऐसे काम करें जिस से कि अधोग योनि में पड़े दुःख पाए," she asks—why should we do deeds that lead to lower birth and suffering? "अपन अच्छे कर्म करें जिस से अच्छी योनि में जाए," she answers—we should do good deeds so we go to good rebirth. "अच्छे विचार रखें बस," she summarizes—keep good thoughts, that's all.

Interestingly, she doesn't want moksha, liberation from the cycle entirely. "और मोक्ष नहीं चाहती कि भगवान के वहाँ जाकर बैठ जाए," she declares—I don't want moksha where I go to God and just sit there. Instead: "पुण्य करो भगवान के वहाँ जाओ थोड़े दिन जितने पुण्य है उतने भोगो फिर वापस आ जाओ," she explains—do good deeds, go to God's realm, enjoy for a while according to your punya (merit), then come back. "फिर मृत्युलोक में ही जन्म लेना पड़ेगा," she continues—will have to take birth again in the mortal world. She wants to keep serving, keep coming back, keep being useful. Permanent mergence with God doesn't appeal to her service-oriented nature.

## **Dealing with People: Making Friends, Not Enemies**

Her approach to human relationships reflects deep psychological understanding. "बुराई अगर किसी की देख ली अपन ने उसको वहीं त्याग दो," she advises—if you see evil in someone, leave it right there. "और अपने मुँह मोड़ के अपना रास्ता पकड़ लो," she continues—turn your face and take your own path.

"संसार में सब तरह की चीज़ें मिलेंगी," she observes—in this world you'll find all types. "अच्छे लोग भी मिलेंगे बुरे भी मिलेंगे," she states—good people and bad people both. The critical instruction: "घृणा किसी से मत करो"—don't hate anyone. Why? "जो वो अपने पर दोबारा वार करें"—because it strikes back at you. Hatred returns to the hater.

"शत्रु पैदा मत करो," she commands—don't create enemies. "मित्र बनाओ सबको," she instructs—make everyone friends. She explains the fundamental choice we face with every person: "मनुष्य अपना ही मित्र है अपना ही शत्रु है"—human being is their own friend, their own enemy.

"तो जो भी लोग मिले उनको शत्रु जैसे सोचोगे अरे कहाँ से आ गया," she illustrates the negative mindset—if you think of people as enemies, "Oh no, where did they come from?" But if you think positively: "और मित्र वा मिल रहा अरे बड़ा अच्छा हुआ"—a friend is meeting, how wonderful\! "मतलब मन में एक वो आ जाएगा प्रमाद आ जाएगा," she notes—in your mind either confusion or clarity comes.

To remove this confusion: "ना तो खुश हो और ना दुःख मनाओ," she advises—neither be too happy nor sad. "सबको समान मानो," she instructs—consider everyone equal. "कि और अच्छी चीज़ों को पकड़ के आगे बढ़ो," she guides—catch the good things and move forward. "उनको फेंक दो कचरे की टोकरी में," she concludes—throw the bad things in the garbage basket.

When someone insults you, her mother's teaching applies. "किसी ने गाली दी तो गाली तुम्हारी नहीं हुई अगर तुम," her mother said—if someone gives you an insult, it's not yours if you don't accept it. "तो हम तो गिरदान लेते ही नहीं थे कि इसने क्या कहा," she explains—we didn't even pay attention to what they said.

"पर दुःख तब होता था," she admits honestly—but sometimes it hurt. When pain came, "तो अपना दुःख हल्का करने के लिए किसी को कहना पड़ता था," she explains—to lighten the sorrow, she had to tell someone. "भाई ऐसा आज हुआ यह हुआ वो हुआ," she would share—brother, this happened today. "बाकी उसका समाधान नहीं हुआ," she notes—but didn't seek solution or revenge. "तो उसको लेकर ही चलते रहे," she continues—just kept moving forward with it.

Her action was measured: "और दूर कर दिया कि उस आदमी से दूर रहो जिस से कम से कम सुनना पड़े," she explains—decided to stay away from that person so I hear minimum from them. "पर उसको जवाब नहीं दिया," she emphasizes—but didn't give them a reply. Didn't retaliate. "क्योंकि वो हमारे साथ एडजस्ट नहीं हो सकता," she reasons—because they can't adjust with us. "अलग रहे हमारे मतलब विचारों से," she concludes—they're different from our thoughts and values. Better to maintain distance than create ongoing conflict.

"तो ऐसे करके अपनी ज़िंदगी मैंने तो निकाली है," she summarizes—this is how I led my life. No gossip—"और जहाँ मुझे मौका मिला गपशप नहीं करती थी मैं," she notes—wherever I got opportunity, I didn't gossip. Focus on work, avoid negativity, make friends, keep distance from those who can't be friends, but never create enemies.

"मेरा तो अब यह जो जीवन है वो ऐसा चल रहा है," she reflects—my life now is proceeding like this.

## **The Debt Philosophy: Serving Without Creating Obligation**

As she's grown older, a particular philosophy has intensified. "मैं सबकी कर्ज़दार थी," she reflects—I was indebted to everyone. "जो मैं चुकाती रही सारे लोन कि भाई इनकी सेवा करो," she explains—which I kept repaying like loans, serving them.

But now her thinking has evolved. "अब मेरे दिमाग में यह चीज़ आ गई," she notes—now this has come to my mind. "किसी की सेवा नहीं लेनी," she states—don't take anyone's service. "चाहे बेटा भी हो," she continues—even if it's your own son. "उसका भी करके चलो," she instructs—do his work yourself too. "जिस से उसका ऋण अपने ऊपर नहीं चढ़े," she reasons—so his debt doesn't accumulate on me.

"जीव का जीव ऋण चढ़ता है," she explains—one being becomes indebted to another being. "मैंने तुम्हारा काम किया तुमने मेरा किया बराबर हो गया," she illustrates—I did your work, you did mine, we're equal. "तुम तुम करते रहोगे तो मैं तुम्हारी कर्ज़दार हो जाऊंगी सेवा की," she warns—if you keep doing for me, I become indebted for the service.

"इसलिए मेरा दिमाग अब ऐसा हो गया है," she concludes—therefore my mind has become like this. At eighty-one, she still does all her own cleaning, organizing, and housework. She can't compromise on three things: "स्वास्थ्य और सफाई और धरा उठाई इनसे अभी तक भी समझौता नहीं कर पाई," she states—health, cleanliness, and organizing, I haven't been able to compromise on these even till now.

"मैं अपने हाथों से सुबह सुबह सफाई वगैरह करती हूँ," she emphasizes—I do cleaning with my own hands every morning. This includes everything—dustbins scrubbed with soap if needed, buckets and mugs washed before every bath, fresh water from the tap only, never reusing water even if someone else bathed. "स्वास्थ हज़ीन का मतलब पूरा ध्यान रखती हूँ," she states—complete attention to hygiene.

The philosophy extends to teaching. "अपने-अपने बिस्तर अपने आप सोकर उठ के तय करो," she instructs—make your own bed after getting up. "सारे घर की को व्यवस्थित कर दो," she continues—organize everything in the house. This isn't just about cleanliness but about self-sufficiency, about not creating debts of service even within family.

## **The Health Crisis and Recovery**

January 2023 brought a moment that could have been fatal. "तीन तारीख को मैं हॉस्पिटल गई थी," she recounts—I went to hospital on the third. Her blood sugar had dropped dangerously. "31 शुगर लेवल पहुँच गया," she states—reached thirty-one. This is critically, life-threateningly low.

Her grandson Somya's reaction captured the family's terror: "दोनों रोने लग गए," she remembers—both started crying. "सोम्या भी कि दादी को क्या हो गया? दादी को क्या हो गया?" she repeats—Somya crying, "What happened to Dadi? What happened to Dadi?"

But Bhavya acted instantly. "भवू इमीडिएटली मेरे को ले गया," she says—Bhavya immediately took me. "अगर पाँच मिनट भी देर हो जाती तो पता नहीं क्या होता," she reflects soberly—if even five minutes delay had happened, who knows what would have happened. "डॉक्टर ने जैसा कि कहा," she adds—as the doctor said. Those five minutes could have been the difference between life and death.

The doctor's orders changed her routine fundamentally. "डॉक्टर ने कहा दो-दो घंटे से खाओ," she explains—doctor said eat every two hours. "तो मैं दो-दो घंटे से खाने लग गई," she states—so I started eating every two hours. "भाई काम छोड़ो पहले खाने में लगो," she instructs herself—brother, leave work, first focus on eating. "कुछ भी खाओ नारियल पानी पियो वर्क करो," she continues—eat anything, drink coconut water, then work.

"तो मेरे को यही चीज़ें पसंद है," she notes—these are the things I like now. Priority has shifted from work to health maintenance. "अब तुम लोगों की सबकी दुआएँ काम कर गई," she says with gratitude—now all of you people's prayers worked. "जी रही है," she concludes simply—I'm living.

## **The Steel Body at Eighty-One**

Looking back at her physical journey, the progression is remarkable. The childhood of walking, carrying water, playing sports, doing drill, practicing throwball (baseball), the NCC training with actual rifle firing, the march practices, the coordination with musical sticks—all of it built what she proudly calls her steel body.

"जब मैं ससुराल में आती थी तो मैं कहती थी स्टैंड और स्टील की बॉडी बनाई बना के दी है," she recalls telling her in-laws. They built and gave her a body of steel. "कितना भी काम कर लो अपन को कोई बीमारी नहीं कुछ नहीं," she declares—any amount of work, no illness comes.

The only exception: "बस सर्दी से बीमारी ब्रोंकाइटिस आती थी," she notes—only from cold, bronchitis would come. This happened during the hectic years of raising children, constantly going in and out, temperature changes. "तब मेरे जीवन में ब्रोंकाइटिस की बीमारी आई," she explains—then bronchitis came in my life. "बाकी कोई बीमारी भी नहीं आई," she emphasizes—otherwise no other illness came.

At eighty-one, medical professionals confirm the results of that steel body. Her teeth, strengthened by decades of sugarcane chewing: "जिस डॉक्टर ने अभी इलाज किया 81 80 इयर्स ओल्ड में उम्र में तो उसने बताया आपके दांत बहुत मज़बूत है," she reports—the doctor who recently treated me at eighty-eighty-one said your teeth are very strong.

Her eyes, maintained by that childhood sadhu's teaching: "उससे मेरी आंखें बिल्कुल ठीक है," she states—from this my eyes are completely fine. "मतलब नसें वगैरह मेरी काफी ठीक है जैसा कि सर्जन ने बताया," she adds—my nerves etc. are very good as the surgeon explained. "दिखाती रहती हूँ यहाँ पे इस उम्र में भी 81 साल की उम्र है," she continues—I keep showing my eyes regularly even at this age of eighty-one. "तो उस समय भी ठीक है मेरी," she concludes—they were good then, they're good now.

Recent health scare aside, the foundation built in childhood continues supporting her eighth decade.

## **The Video Call: Connecting Generations**

The interview itself, conducted via video call during winter break in January 2023, reveals the bridge between generations. Her grandchildren, calling from abroad, show her their virtual reality experiences—"वर्चुअल रियलिटी," a new technology she's never heard of. They explain the digital world you can see through devices. "अच्छा," she responds with interest—I see.

They share their artwork. Naman shows his burn art on wood, resin art pieces, calligraphy and lettering practice. "मैंने यह मेसेज लिख लिया आपके लिए," he explains—I wrote this message for you. "Enjoy Every Moment," the artwork reads. "बहुत बढ़िया," she responds warmly—very good.

They discuss their college studies—computer science, data science, entrepreneurship courses. "बहुत बढ़िया बात," she approves—very good thing. "सफलता के मार्ग पर चल रहे हो," she encourages—walking on the path of success. "डेवलपिंग स्किल है अच्छी बात," she notes—developing skills, good thing. "कोई ना कोई हॉबी डेवलप करते रहो," she advises—keep developing some hobby or other.

They show her Google Maps, searching for her old addresses. Dariba Kalan in Old Delhi—"यह है दादी यह है दरीबा कलान रोड," they point out. The railway bungalow locations, long changed. Ramjas College, still standing—"यह है आपकी स्कूल," they confirm—this is your school. She peers at the screen, memory and present converging. "हाँ ऐसा ही था," she confirms—yes, it was like this.

St. Paul's School in Kota, Udaipur addresses, Jodhpur locations—one by one they reconstruct her geographic journey through technology. When her memory wavers on exact locations, "अब याद नहीं बेटा मुझे तो इतना," she admits—don't remember now, son, that much. But when an image clicks: "हाँ यह है इधर शी स्टेड," she confirms—yes this is it, here she stayed.

It's 1:00 PM. "गुड आफ्टरनून 1 ओ क्लॉक," someone notes—good afternoon, one o'clock. "हाँ 1 PM है तो आप लंच खाओ अभी," they tell her—it's 1 PM, you eat lunch now. "से मिलने जाऊँगी अभी तो," she responds—I'll go meet someone now. Multiple "बाय बाय बाय"s echo as the call ends, a conversation across continents, across generations, documenting a life that spanned from pre-Independence India to the digital age.

## **The Legacy: What Remains**

As the interview closes, what emerges isn't just a life story but a philosophy, a template for how to live with purpose, dignity, and constant growth.

From childhood she learned self-sufficiency—carrying water when needed, walking to school regardless of distance, building physical strength through practical activity. She learned spiritual practices young and maintained them for eight decades. The eye-washing with water-filled mouth, the sugarcane chewing, the physical discipline—these weren't temporary enthusiasms but lifetime commitments.

When education was denied her as a girl, she fought for it. Not with anger but with firm insistence: "हम तो पढ़ेंगे"—I will study. She struggled, especially for college, but never wavered. Her father eventually supported her, and she completed not just BA but MA, not to mention B.Ed. and decades of additional courses.

When Economics education showed her global development patterns, she applied them at home. India was developing, she would help develop her household. "कैसे अपने को आगे बढ़ाएं बच्चों को कैसे बढ़ाएं," she made her mission—how to advance ourselves, advance our children.

When faced with the choice between career and family, she chose deliberately. Two works or one? She chose one—household work—but elevated it to worship. "इन्हीं का काम जो है वो मेरे लिए वर्क है वही वर्क इज़ वरशिप है," she explained. Their work is my work, that work is worship. "यह सब भगवान के जीव हैं," she reasoned—these are all God's beings. Serving them was serving God.

She taught her children three core values from her mother: don't steal, don't lie, don't hurt with words. "यही भगवान की सेवा है," her mother had said—this itself is serving God. She added lessons on sharing, on earning through own effort, on returning even borrowed pencils. The enforcement was firm. The results showed in three successful sons who learned honesty and hard work.

She never stopped learning. Even while raising three sons and often extended family, she pursued courses: food preservation in 1978, cookery and bakery in 1981, cutting and tailoring in 1987, kitchen gardening with prizes, music through second year, astrology in 2001, first aid in 1959\. Her daughter-in-law compiled the certificates—testimony to six decades of continuous growth.

From the Gita and Puranas she extracted philosophical framework. The four ashrams gave her life structure. The karma philosophy guided her actions. "खुशी दोगे तो खुशी लोगे," she understood—give happiness, get happiness. After death, tenfold return. So choose good actions, good thoughts.

Human relationships followed clear principles: make friends not enemies, throw bad things in garbage basket, don't hate because it returns to you, maintain distance from those incompatible but never create active conflict. "मनुष्य अपना ही मित्र है अपना ही शत्रु है," she taught—humans are their own friends, their own enemies. The choice is ours.

Even debt became spiritual concept. "किसी की सेवा नहीं लेनी," she now believes—don't take anyone's service. Even from own children. Do everything yourself so debt doesn't accumulate. "जीव का जीव ऋण चढ़ता है," she explains—one being becomes indebted to another. At eighty-one, she still does all her own cleaning, maintaining standards that won't compromise.

The daily spiritual practice at eighty-one shows her current focus: three aartis at 7 AM, writing "Jai Shri Krishna" two pages daily (four malas), reading Gita, attending Puran discourses. "और इस से मुझे बहुत अच्छी शांति मिली है," she testifies—from this I've received very good peace. The Sanyas Ashram stage means gradual detachment from world, increasing engagement with God. "मुझे दुनिया से को छोड़ना है," she explains—I must leave worldly attachments. "धीरे-धीरे कटिंग करनी है हर चीज़ की और भगवान में लगना है," she continues—gradually cut from everything and engage in God.

Yet she doesn't want moksha, permanent mergence. "मोक्ष नहीं चाहती कि भगवान के वहाँ जाकर बैठ जाए," she declares. She wants to keep returning, keep serving. "पुण्य करो भगवान के वहाँ जाओ थोड़े दिन जितने पुण्य है उतने भोगो फिर वापस आ जाओ," she explains—do good, go to God, enjoy fruits of merit, then come back. The cycle continues because service continues.

When medical emergency struck—sugar level at thirty-one—Bhavya's immediate action saved her. "अगर पाँच मिनट भी देर हो जाती तो पता नहीं क्या होता," she acknowledges—five minutes could have been fatal. But prayers worked. "अब तुम लोगों की सबकी दुआएँ काम कर गई जी रही है," she says gratefully—everyone's prayers worked, I'm living.

The steel body built in childhood, strengthened through decades of discipline, maintains her still. Eyes excellent from childhood water practice. Teeth strong from sugarcane. Overall health robust despite eighty-one years, one hospitalization, one chronic bronchitis from cold. She attributes everything to early foundation: physical training, wholesome food, disciplined practice, no compromises on cleanliness.

Her advice to grandchildren combines traditional and modern understanding. Keep developing skills. Keep learning. Make friends. Do good actions because they return tenfold. Serve but don't create debts. "कोई ना कोई हॉबी डेवलप करते रहो," she encourages—keep developing hobbies. Growth doesn't stop at any age.

## **Conclusion: "Do or Die"**

If one phrase captures her life, it's the lesson from NCC that still runs in her mind after sixty years: "डू एंड डाई"—Do or Die. When girls weren't encouraged in education, she insisted and succeeded. When Economics was her weakest subject, she completed Honours. When career conflicted with family, she chose family but elevated it to spiritual practice. When courses were available, she took them into her sixties. When spiritual practice called, she answered with daily discipline. When health crisis struck, she recovered and adapted.

"मेरा तो अब यह जो जीवन है वो ऐसा चल रहा है," she reflects at the interview's end—my life now is proceeding like this. Not with complaint, not with regret, but with continued purpose. The four ashrams gave structure. The three principles from mother gave foundation. The karma philosophy gave motivation. The steel body gave capability. The continuous learning gave adaptability. The spiritual practice gave peace.

"बस मेरा यही उद्देश्य है कि जो आश्रम मैंने गुज़ारा उसको मैं अच्छी तरह गुज़ारूं," she summarizes—my goal is whatever ashram stage I'm passing through, I pass through it properly. She did childhood properly. She did householder stage properly, raising family with values. She did retirement stage properly, managing ceremonies and celebrations. Now she does renunciation stage properly, focusing on God while maintaining dignity and independence.

"अच्छे विचार रखें बस," she advises finally—keep good thoughts, that's all. Simple advice from eight decades of living. Good thoughts, good actions, good karma. Serve without creating debt. Learn without stopping. Make friends without making enemies. Throw bad in garbage, keep good close. Share what you have. Return what you borrowed. Don't steal, don't lie, don't hurt with words—this is serving God.

From pre-Independence railway bungalow with lamp-lit nights and carried water to video calls with grandchildren across continents discussing virtual reality, from walking miles to school with cloth bags to managing households across cities with three sons educated to success, from fighting for her own education to teaching generations without hired tutors, from learning dozens of courses to writing four malas of "Jai Shri Krishna" daily in neat columns—this is a life lived with intention, adaptation, and unwavering commitment to growth and service.

At eighty-one, after recent brush with death, she continues. Three aartis each morning. Two pages of writing. Gita reading. Standards that don't compromise. "और इस से मुझे बहुत अच्छी शांति मिली है," she testifies—from this I've received very good peace.

The grandchildren will return to their studies, their computer science and data science and entrepreneurship courses. The video call will end. But the documentation remains—a life that spanned nearly a century of change, maintained steel-body strength and clear-minded philosophy, fought necessary battles and avoided unnecessary ones, learned continuously and taught generously, chose service over career but elevated service to worship, and at eighty-one still writes daily prayers in neat columns, attends three aartis each morning, and maintains standards of cleanliness that won't compromise.

"Do or Die" she learned at nineteen. At eighty-one, she still lives it.

**Jai Shri Krishna.** 🙏
