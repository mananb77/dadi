## **🌟 Her Philosophy**

From the Bhagavad Gita, she believed:

* **Karma**: "Give happiness, receive happiness. Give sorrow, receive sorrow 10-fold"

* "I don't want moksha (liberation) immediately. Do good deeds, enjoy heaven for a while, then come back to serve again"  
* She survived a critical health scare (blood sugar 31\) because "everyone's prayers worked"  
* She lived simply, prayed daily, and found peace in routine and devotion

## **📖 Her Legacy**

She didn't pursue a PhD or a big career, but she created something greater: three educated sons, a loving family spanning four generations, and a living example of how to walk through life with integrity, devotion, and grace.

Her students remember her. Their mothers still speak of her. Her children embody her values. Her grandchildren recorded her stories. Her great-grandchildren will know her voice.

**She didn't just live 81 years. She lived with purpose, raised her family with values, never stopped learning, served everyone without expectation, maintained rigorous discipline in cleanliness and spirituality, and spent her final years in peaceful devotion.**

**From railway bungalows without electricity to modern Jaipur, from partition-era India to the digital age, from a young NCC cadet with a rifle to a grandmother writing "Jai Shri Krishna" 888 times daily \- she witnessed and adapted to everything while never compromising her core values.**

**Rest in eternal peace, Dadi. Your light continues through all of us.** 🙏✨
