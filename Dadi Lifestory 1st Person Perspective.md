# **My Life Story: A Journey of Strength, Service, and Spirit**

*As told by me, January 2023, at age 81*

---

## **The Beginning: A Child of the Railways**

I was born in Delhi in the early 1940s, when India still lived under British rule. My father, Shri Ram Bhargava, was born in 1901 and served as a Senior Mail Rail Guard in the Indian Railways—a position of some importance. My mother's name was Narayani, and she came from Narnaul. I was the seventh child in our family of eleven children. "मेरे चार भाई थे और मेरे अलावा तीन बहनें थी," I explain—I had four brothers, and besides me, three sisters. One sister was younger than me, two were older.

My father's father was Hardayal Singh Bhargava, from Rewari. My grandmother came from Harsoli village near Rewari. "हमारे फैमिली में सिंह भी है," I note—in our family we have Singh too, from that side of the family. My father was the kind of man who hoisted the flag at the railway station—that's the kind of standing he had.

We lived in a large railway bungalow behind the station, provided by the government as part of my father's employment. "बड़ा बंगला था जिसमें तीन चार कमरे थे," I remember—it was a big bungalow with three or four rooms. The bathroom and toilet stood outside the main house. "लैट्रिन बाथरूम बाहर था। बरांडा था," I describe—latrine and bathroom were outside, there was a veranda.

In front of the house, "आगे बहुत सारा फेंसिंग था। सर्वेंट क्वार्टर्स बने हुए थे," there was lots of fencing, and servant quarters were built. "तो उसमें सर्वेंट्स में एक टीचर रहते थे। एक में धोबन रहती थी," I recall—in the servant quarters, one teacher lived, and in another the washerwoman lived. "तो इस तरह वो लोग हमारा काम कर दिया करते थे," they would help us with our daily work.

But this was the India of the 1940s and early 1950s, and even a railway officer's home lacked many basic amenities. In those early years, there was no electricity at all.

## **Life Without Electricity: The Lamp-Lit Years**

"पहले इतना ज्यादा होता ज्यादा ड्रेस पहनते थे," I remember those days before we got better facilities. Let me tell you about the time before 1953-54, "54-55 के पहले 51-52 की यह बात है। 1952, 1953, 1953 की बात है यह," this is from 1952, 1953\.

Every evening brought the ritual of lighting lamps and lanterns. I can still describe the meticulous process: "हमारे घर के लोग लैंप की जो चिमनिया होती थी या लैंप की चिमनिया होती थी उन्हें राख से साफ करते थे कपड़े से पोंछते थे और फिर उनको तैयार करते थे शाम के लिए।" Our family would clean the lamp chimneys with ash in the morning or evening, wipe them with cloth, and prepare them for evening use. "रात में वह जला करती थी," these lamps would burn through the night.

The house was quite large. "बड़ा मकान था हमारा तो हमें कोई परेशानी नहीं थी," we had a big house so we didn't face troubles. "लैट्रिन बाथरूम नहीं हुआ करते थे स्टोर होते थे," there were no latrine-bathrooms built in, there were storage rooms. "और खाना बनाने की रसोई अलग से नहीं होती थी। उसी में खाना बना करता था," and there was no separate kitchen room for cooking—food was cooked in that same space.

"मतलब एक छोटा कमरा होता था जिसमें तान लगी होती थी पत्थर की," there was one small room with a stone shelf built into it. "और उस पर सामान रखा रहता था," items would be stored on the shelf. "और नीचे अंगीठी जला के या चुल्हा जला के खाना बनता था। यह बात है," and below, lighting the angithi (coal stove) or chulha (traditional stove), food would be cooked. This is how it was.

## **The Water Challenge: Learning Self-Sufficiency**

Perhaps nothing captures the reality of those early years better than our daily struggle for water. "कोटा जयपुर नहीं आए। कोटा से अजमेर," wait, I'm talking about even earlier times now. Let me tell you properly about the 1950 period.

"1950 घर में नल नहीं हुआ करते थे," in 1950 there were no taps in the house. "तो हम एक आदमी को एंगेज करते थे," so we would hire a man. "वो अपने कंधों पर एक लकड़ी की बैंगी जिसे बोलते थे वो बनी रहती थी," he would carry on his shoulders what we called a wooden baingi (pole). "उसमें लोहे के वो लटके रहते थे मोटे सरिए जिसे कहना चाहिए थोड़ा मोटा तार," thick iron wires or rods would hang from it. "उसमें वो कुंडा होता था," there were hooks on them.

"तो उस कुंडे में वो कैनस्टर जो होते हैं घी तेल के उसको काट के बीच में एक लकड़ी लगा लेते थे," in those hooks, we'd hang canisters—the kind used for ghee or oil, cut in half with a wooden handle attached through the middle. "और वो लकड़ी जो होती थी उसमें उसको बैंगी को फंसा लेते थे," and that wooden handle would hook onto the baingi. "वो ऐसे मुड़े हुए कुंडे होते थे," these were curved hooks.

"उन्हें फंसा लेते थे और कंधे पर ले चलते थे," he would hook them on and carry them on his shoulders. "तो दो एक बार में दो दो कैनस्टर पानी लाया करता था 32 लीटर्स," so two canisters at a time, bringing 32 liters. Each canister held "16 लीटर्स ईच," 16 liters each.

My grandchildren explain it well: "बेसिकली व्हाट इट वास इट वास द वुडन थिंग एंड ऑन बोथ साइड द वुडन एंड ऑफ़ द स्टिक यू विल पुट 16 लीटर कैन एल्युमिनियम कैन एंड देन दे टू कैरी द वाटर बिकॉज़ दे डिड नॉट हैव नो रनिंग वाटर," basically it was a wooden thing with a stick, and on both sides you'd put a 16-liter aluminum can, and they'd carry the water because we didn't have running water. "एंड दे हैव इलेक्ट्रिसिटी बैक इन 1950 आल्सो," and we had electricity back in 1950 also—actually, we got electricity by then.

"उसके बाद हमने ठहरा लिए की हमारे चार बैंगी पानी डालेगा आठ कैनस्टर," after that we arranged that he would make four trips for us, bringing eight canisters. "ऐसे ठहरा लेते थे," this is how we arranged it.

But even this wasn't always enough. "फिर भी अगर जरूरत है," even then if there was need—because "हम जरा साफ सफाई से रहते थे," we lived with cleanliness. "पौधे वगैरह हमारे यहां बहुत थे," we had many plants. "लॉन था हेजेज लगी हुई थी चारों तरफ," there was a lawn with hedges all around. "हमारे भाई लोग करते थे," my brothers would take care of them. "तो बगीचा था सब तरह से आराम था," so there was a garden, everything comfortable.

"तो हमें जब ज्यादा जरूरत पड़ती थी तो हम खुद नल पर गए," so when we needed more water, we ourselves went to the tap. "और 100 मीटर दूर पर नल था," and the tap was about 100 meters away. "वहां से भर भर के बाल्टियां हम बच्चे से ले आते थे," from there, filling buckets, we children would bring them back. "और काम अपना चला लेते थे," and we would manage our work.

For bathing, we improvised. "और धोने के लिए पर्दा डाल के रखते थे," for bathing we would hang a curtain. "जाफरी लगी हुई थी," an iron grill was already installed. "पहले जाफरी बोलते थे वो लोहे की बनी हुई होती थी," earlier we called it jafri—it was made of iron. "और उसके मतलब वो लगा ली थी उसमें बरांडे में," it was installed there in the veranda. "और वहीं पर पर्दा डाल के हम लोग एक अलग ही नहा लेते थे," and right there, hanging a curtain, we would bathe separately.

"मतलब एक डोली जैसे पानी बाहर नहीं जाएगा। नाली से बाहर जाएगा," meaning like a small enclosure where water wouldn't spill outside—it would drain out through the drain. "और हम वहां नहाया करते थे," and we would bathe there.

## **Walking to School: Building Strength**

My school was the railway school. "फिर उसके बाद स्कूल तो हमारा स्कूल वहां से दो ती किलोमीटर पड़ता था," my school was about one and a half kilometers away. "पैदल जाते थे," we would walk. "बस्ता कंधे पर लटका के और पैदल चला करते थे स्कूल में," with our bag hanging on our shoulder, we would walk to school.

"सो जैसे अपना शिमत जी का बैग है ना दैट वास द बैग शी टू कैरी ऑन शोल्डर्स," the bag was like a cloth sack that we carried on our shoulders. "थैलियों के बस्ते होते थे जैसे थैला होता है वैसा बस्ता होता था," they were cloth bags, like a sack. "उसमें अपना सामान भरा और हम लोग स्कूल चले गए," we'd fill them with our materials and go to school.

"स्कूल दूध भी मिलता था वहां पे क्योंकि रेलवे का था," at school we also got milk because it was a railway school. "और फीस दो महीना फीस पिताजी की सैलरी में से कट के फिर उनको सारी सैलरी मिलती थी," and fees—two months' fees would be deducted from father's salary, then he'd receive his full salary. "जो भी एक्सपेंसेस होते थे वो सब कट के मिलते थे," whatever expenses there were, all would be deducted before he got paid.

At school, we respected our teachers greatly. "पहले मास्टर बोलते थे भैया जी बोलते थे," earlier we would call them Master, we'd call them Bhaiya Ji. "तो हम मास्टर साहब से पढ़ते थे," so we studied with Master Sahab. "वो पढ़ाते थे," they would teach us. "अच्छा लेक्चर वगैरह होते," there were good lectures.

## **The Lessons That Lasted a Lifetime**

Sometimes they would invite special guests to teach us. "तो कोई साधु संत को बुला लेते थे," they would call some sadhu or saint. "और वो साधु संत आके बता के जाते थे कि आपको कैसे अपने को स्वस्थ रखना है," and those sadhus would come and teach us how to keep ourselves healthy.

"तो वो एक बार मुझे अभी भी याद है और मैं अभी भी करती हूं," one time I still remember and I still do it. "कि अपने आंखों मुंह में पानी भर के पुच पुच करके और मतलब चला के मुंह को और आंखों में छपके देती हूं," fill your mouth with water and splash it on your face and eyes, rinse repeatedly and splash on the eyes.

"उससे मेरी आंखें बिल्कुल ठीक है," from this my eyes are completely fine. "मतलब नसें वगैरह मेरी काफी ठीक है जैसा कि सर्जन ने बताया," my nerves etc. are very good as the surgeon explained. "दिखाती रहती हूं यहां पे इस उम्र में भी 81 साल की उम्र है," I keep showing my eyes regularly even at this age—81 years. "तो उस समय भी ठीक है मेरी," back then also they were fine, now also fine.

Then there was the sugarcane. "दांतों के लिए हम लोग गन्ने खाया करते थे," for teeth, we used to eat sugarcane. "गन्ने को छीला और छीलने के बाद मुंह से गंडेरिया चूसा करते थे," we would peel the sugarcane and chew it with our mouths to extract the juice. "तो मेरे दांत बहुत मजबूत है," so my teeth are very strong.

"जिस डॉक्टर ने अभी इलाज किया 81 80 इयर्स ओल्ड में उम्र में तो उसने बताया आपके दांत बहुत मजबूत है," the doctor who recently treated me at 80-81 years old said, "Your teeth are very strong." "यह गन्ने खाने का काम तो शादी के बाद भी चलता रहा," this sugarcane eating continued even after marriage.

"हम एक-एक मन गन्ने खरीद लेते थे," we would buy one entire "man" of sugarcane (about 40 kg). "छत पर बैठ जाते थे," we'd sit on the roof terrace. "और उसकी जो गांठ होती है, उसको उससे तोड़ा करते थे। सुरते से," and break it at the joints using a knife. "और मुंह से छील के गन्ना और गिरी खाया करते थे," and peel it with our mouths and chew the inner part.

My grandchildren explain it well for their understanding: "सो बेसिकली रॉ रॉ गन्ना रॉ शुगर केन यू कट इट विद बिग यू कैन से चिज़ल और समथिंग एंड देन बिटवीन द टू जॉइंट्स यू कैन पील इट ऑफ यूजिंग द माउथ एंड यू कैन जस्ट च्यू द गन्ना टू गेट द शुगर केन एंड देन यू थ्रो अवे द रेस्ट द स्टफ।" Basically, raw sugarcane, you cut it, between the two joints you peel it using your mouth, chew the sugarcane to get the juice, and throw away the fibrous rest.

"सो शी यूज़ड टू ईट बिफोर एंड आफ्टर," I used to eat before and after marriage. "इनफ आई यूज़ड टू ईट टू व्हेन आई वास लाइक 8 इयर्स ओल्ड नाइन इयर्स ओल्ड 10 इयर्स ओल्ड," when I was like 8, 9, 10 years old, I used to eat sugarcane.

Between all these activities—the daily walks to school, playing sports, eating good food, drinking milk at school—"मतलब सॉलिड बॉडी बना ली थी," I built a solid body. A steel body, really.

## **My Birth and Early Family**

"मैं दिल्ली दिल्ली में मेरा जन्म हुआ था," I was born in Delhi. "जी की सेवथं औलाद," I was the seventh child. "सेवथं चाइल्ड थी," I was the seventh child.

"मेरे चार भाई थे और मेरे अलावा तीन बहनें थी," I had four brothers and besides me three sisters. "एक बहन छोटी थी, दो बहनें बड़ी थी," one sister was younger, two sisters were older than me.

My father was special. "एक भैया की शादी सन 54 में हुई थी। वहां से मुझे याद है," one brother's wedding happened in 1954—from then I remember clearly. "सबसे बड़े भाई की शादी कब हुई वो मुझे याद नहीं है," the eldest brother's wedding, I don't remember when that was. "लेकिन 54 में जिन सेकंड नंबर भाई की शादी हुई वो मुझे याद है," but in 54, the second number brother's wedding I remember. "गंगापुर सिटी से हुई थी," it happened from Gangapur City. "राजस्थान का एक शहर है," a city in Rajasthan.

## **The Big Change: Father's Retirement (1955)**

"फिर हमारे पिताजी सन 55 में रिटायर हो गए," then my father retired in 1955\. "56 से हम दिल्ली में पढ़ने लगे," from 56 onward we went back to Delhi to study. "शी वास 16 इयर्स ओल्ड एट दैट टाइम," I was 16 years old at that time. "स्वीट 16 बाय द वे," sweet sixteen, by the way, as they say.

The family situation was difficult. "उनको पेंशन नहीं थी। पीएफ मिला था," he didn't get a pension, only Provident Fund. "तो उसमें उन्होंने पांच शादियां करनी थी," and with that he had to arrange five weddings. "पांच शादी हम घर के मकान में रहते थे," five weddings, and we lived in our family house.

"अपना मकान था हमारा। 22 24 कमरे थे उसमें," it was our own house with 22-24 rooms. "छोटे-छोटे कमरे हुआ करते थे," there were small rooms. "बीच में चौक और चारों तरफ कमरे," a courtyard in the middle and rooms all around. "उसमें हम रहते थे," that's where we lived.

"और उन्होंने दो शादी की 57 में 59 में," and they arranged two weddings in 57 and 59\. "फिर हम पढ़े क्योंकि इसलिए हमारी देर में शादी हुई," then I studied, which is why my marriage happened late. "तो 67 में हमारी मैरिज हुई," so in 67 my marriage happened.

"एंड मीन टाइम गर्ल्स एजुकेशन वास नॉट सो ड पार्टेड," and in the meantime, girls' education was not so supported. But, "ही गव हर परमिशन एंड फील्ड टू स्टडी," he gave his permission and allowed me to study.

## **The Struggle for Education in Delhi**

Getting admission wasn't easy. "जैसे आठवीं पास की उसके बाद दिल्ली पहुंच गए," after passing eighth standard, we reached Delhi. "सारे स्कूल हमारी भाभी रहती थी वहां पर भाई रहते थे," my sister-in-law lived there, my eldest brother lived there. "सबसे बड़े उन्होंने ट्राई किया भाभी ने," the eldest one, my sister-in-law tried. "वो दिल्ली दिल्ली की लड़की थी और दिल्ली में ही शादी हुई थी," she was a Delhi girl and her marriage happened in Delhi.

"तो उन्होंने ट्राई किया तो वो गवर्नमेंट स्कूल में हमें ले गई," so she tried and took me to a government school. "पढ़ाने के पहले गवर्नमेंट स्कूल ज्यादा चलते थे। प्राइवेट कम होते थे," in those days government schools were more common, private schools fewer. "उनको पढ़ाने ले गई तो जमा मस्जिद के गवर्नमेंट स्कूल था," she took me to enroll at the Jama Masjid government school. "वहां हो गई थी। हमें जगह नहीं मिली," there wasn't space for me.

"फिर उसके बाद हमें वहां राजघाट वहां लेके गए," then after that they took me to Rajghat. "राजघाट के वहां एक गवर्नमेंट गर्ल्स स्कूल है," there's a government girls' school there in Rajghat. "उसमें हमारी भाभी ने एडमिशन दिलाया प्रिंसिपल से," my sister-in-law got me admission there through the principal. "और वहां हम पढ़ने लगे," and there I started studying.

The school was far. "वो हमारे घर से करीब राजघाट चार पांच किलोमीटर तो हो ही गई मतलब," it was about 4-5 kilometers from our home. "तो हम पहले एक बस लगाई," so first they arranged a bus. "उसमें जो जहरी वगैरह होते उनकी लड़कियां हम लोग और भी बहुत लड़कियां पूरे भर के बस जाती थी," in it were us, daughters of jewelers and many other girls—the bus would be completely full.

"और फिर वो भी बंद हो गई," and then that also stopped. "तो ₹1 लेती थी उस समय बस किराया जाने का और आने का," the bus fare at that time was ₹1 for going and coming. "अ मंथ," for a month\! "ओ माय गॉड वाओ," my grandchildren exclaim.

"एक महीना ही चली उसके बाद बंद बंद हो गई बस," it ran for only one month then stopped. "और हम लोग पैदल जाया करते थे," and we would walk. "हमें आधा घंटा लगता था," it took us half an hour. "परेड ग्राउंड वहां से दरियागंज। दरियागंज से घंटा मस्जिद और घंटा मस्जिद के पास हमारा स्कूल था," from Parade Ground to Dariyaganj, from Dariyaganj to Ghanta Masjid, and near Ghanta Masjid was our school.

"वहां हम थे नाइंथ टेंथ इलेवथ वहां पढ़ा हमने," there I studied ninth, tenth, eleventh. The full name was "गवर्नमेंट हायर सेकेंडरी स्कूल दरियागंज," Government Higher Secondary School Dariyaganj. "नियर राजघाट," near Rajghat. "गांधी जी की समाधि है उसके पास ही जगह है आधा किलोमीटर दूर पे ही होगा," Gandhi Ji's memorial is there, about half a kilometer away from where we studied.

## **My Spiritual Life in School Days**

During these years, my mind was always on studies. "बस पढ़ाई में ही दिमाग रहता था," my mind was only on studies. But I was also spiritual. "हां नाइंथ में मैं पढ़ती थी तो 11 तक मैंने ढाई हजार गायत्री मंत्र लिखे थे और 5000 लिखे थे," when I was in ninth through eleventh, I wrote 2,500 Gayatri Mantras and then 5,000.

"ढाई हजार का मेरे पास अभी भी कागज़ है," I still have the paper for the 2,500. "कि मैंने सन 60 में मथुरा तपोभूमि और ढाई हजार मंत्र भेजे," that I sent 2,500 mantras to Mathura Tapobhoomi in 1960\.

"मैं आदर्शवादी थी," I was idealistic. "आध्यात्मिक भी थी," I was also spiritual. "मेरी दादी को मैं पढ़ के सुनाती थी कृष्ण लीला और रामायण," I would read Krishna Leela and Ramayana aloud to my grandmother. "वो पढ़ी लिखी नहीं थी," she couldn't read or write. "मां तो हमारी पढ़ लेती थी," my mother could read. "लेकिन दादी पढ़ नहीं पाती थी," but grandmother couldn't read. "तो मैं उनको सिखा सुनाती थी," so I would read to her.

My grandmother—your great-great-great-grandmother—was special. "वो शी वास अ वेरी आइडियलिस्टिक पर्सन विद लॉट ऑफ गुड कैरेक्टर एंड प्रिंसिपल्स," she was a very idealistic person with lots of good character and principles. She came from Harsoli village near Rewari in UP. My grandfather, Hardayal Singh, was from Rewari.

"और बाजार बाजार चले जाते थे," and we'd go to the market. "सिलाई कढ़ाई बुनाई सीख ली," I learned sewing, embroidery, and knitting. "म्यूज़िक सीखा," I learned music. "यह मतलब यह चीज़ें याद है मुझे ज्यादा," these are the things I remember more.

## **College: Ramjas and Economics**

After eleventh, "फिर नाइन 10थ 11 करने के बाद हमने कहा हम तो पढ़ेंगे," after ninth, tenth, eleventh, I said I will study further. "हमारे पिताजी और हमारी दादी भी थी," my father and my grandmother were there. "वो मेरे पिताजी का जन्म सन एक का था 1901 का," my father was born in 1901\. "इस समय होते तो तुम्हारे पापा के दादा जी 122 साल के होते," if he were alive now, your Papa's grandfather would be 122 years old. "191 हर डैड गॉट बोर्न इन 1901," my father was born in 1901\.

"तो हमने पढ़ाई का आगे रखा कि हम तो पढ़ेंगे," so I kept insisting I would study. "उसके लिए हमें थोड़ा सा स्ट्रगल करना पड़ा," for this I had to struggle a bit. "क्योंकि पढ़ाने को तैयार नहीं थे," because they weren't ready to let me study. "पिताजी रिटायर हो गए थे और उनकी पीएफ मिला था। उनको पेंशन नहीं थी," father had retired and got his PF, he didn't have pension. "पीएफ मिला था। तो उसमें उन्होंने पांच शादियां करनी थी," and with that he had to arrange five weddings.

Getting into college was interesting. "जो मेरे नंबर तीन भाई थे तीसरा नंबर सबसे बड़े उससे छोटे उससे छोटे तीसरा नंबर ऊपर से," my third brother—from the top, first, second, then third. "उन्होंने मेरे को वो राम जस कॉलेज से पढ़े हुए थे," he had studied at Ramjas College. "उन्होंने भी बीए ऑनर्स इकोनॉमिक्स में किया था," he had also done BA Honours in Economics.

"वहां के जो हेड ऑफ द डिपार्टमेंट थे वो एन अग्रवाल थे," the Head of Department there was N. Agarwal. "तो उन्होंने मेरे को वहां एडमिशन दिलाया और इकोनॉमिक्स में ढलाया," so he got me admission there and pushed me into Economics. "जिसमें की मेरे सबसे कम नंबर आए थे 60% आए थे," which was where I got my lowest marks—60% I got.

"और मेरे ज्यादा थे डिस्टिंक्शन मार्क्स था लोअर मैथ्स एंड डोमेस्टिक साइंस में," and I had more, distinction marks in Lower Mathematics and Domestic Science. "पर उन्होंने मेरे को वो मार्क्स वो दिलवाया," but they got me those marks. "इकोनॉमिक्स मेरे कम नंबर थे," Economics had my low marks. "लेकिन हेड ऑफ द डिपार्टमेंट वो जानते थे," but the Head of Department knew my brother. "इसलिए करवाया एडमिशन," that's why they arranged admission.

"मैं वहां तीन साल पढ़ी," I studied there for three years. "दो साल पढ़ने के बाद फर्स्ट ईयर सेकंड ईयर किया तो मतलब उस समय मेरे को इंग्लिश और हिंदी दो तो मतलब दो सब्जेक्ट तो फर्स्ट ईयर में छूट गए," after two years—first year, second year—English and Hindi, two subjects, got cleared in first year. "मतलब क्लियर कर लिए," meaning I cleared them.

"उसके बाद पॉलिटिकल साइंस ऑप्शनल लिया," after that I took Political Science as optional. "वो यह हिंदी इंग्लिश कंपलसरी सब्जेक्ट थे," Hindi and English were compulsory subjects. "और पॉलिटिकल साइंस वो ऑप्शनल था," and Political Science was optional. "वो सब्जेक्ट लिया था तो वो सेकंड ईयर में क्लियर कर लिया," that subject I cleared in second year.

"उसके बाद थर्ड ईयर में आठ पेपर रह गए जो इकोनॉमिक्स के थे," after that in third year, eight papers remained which were of Economics. "उसमें एग्ज़ाम दिया," I gave exams in those.

I also joined the Delhi School of Economics. "पास में रामजस कॉलेज के दिल्ली स्कूल ऑफ इकोनॉमिक्स था," near Ramjas College was the Delhi School of Economics. "वहां की मेंबरशिप ले ली थी," I took membership there. "और जो इंग्लिश राइटर्स थे बेन्थम वगैरह माल्थस इनकी हम किताबें पढ़ा करते थे लाइब्रेरी के अंदर," and the English writers—Bentham, Malthus—their books we would read in the library.

"और इंग्लिश नोट्स इंग्लिश में बनाते थे," and we'd make notes in English. "इंग्लिश में ही पेपर होते थे," papers were in English. "इंग्लिश में ही पढ़ाया जाता था," teaching was in English.

The college was at "रामजस कॉलेज मॉरिस नगर दिल्ली," Ramjas College, Maurice Nagar, Delhi. My daily commute was quite a journey. "हमारा घर जो था वो दरीवे में था," our house was in Dariba. "दरीवा कला में," in Dariba Kalan. "वहां से हम स्प्लेंडिड रोड पर आते थे," from there we'd come to Splendid Road. "साइकिल मार्केट जिसे कहते हैं," to what's called Cycle Market. "वहां से आने के बाद हम लाल किला आ जाते थे," after coming from there we'd reach Lal Qila (Red Fort).

"स्पेशल बसेस लगा देते थे 9-10 बजे जब कॉलेज का टाइम होता था," they would run special buses at 9-10 AM when it was college time. "तो स्पेशल बसेस लग जाती थी," special buses would run. "उसमें हम मॉरिस नगर आके उतरते थे," in them we'd come to Maurice Nagar and get down. "वहां पे कमला नेहरू कॉलेज भी था," Kamala Nehru College was there. "और बीच में इंद्रप्रस्थ कॉलेज पड़ता था," and in between was Indraprastha College. "और फिर वहां से हम अपने कॉलेज चले जाते थे रामजस कॉलेज," and from there we'd go to our college, Ramjas College.

"और रामजस कॉलेज में पढ़ने के बाद फिर वापस बस में ही बैठते थे," and after studying at Ramjas College, we'd return by bus. "और बस में बैठ के आ जाते थे अपने घर," and sitting in the bus would come to our home. "लाल किला उतरते थे वहां से फिर आ जाते थे," we'd get down at Lal Qila and come from there.

"तीन साल पहले वहां पे फर्स्ट ईयर सेकंड ईयर थर्ड ईयर," for three years there—first year, second year, third year. "64 तक पढ़ी हूं," I studied till 1964\.

In my class, "हम करीब 22 के करीब स्टूडेंट थे," we were about 22 students. "जिसमें हम चार चार लड़कियां थे कॉलेज में क्लास के अंदर," in which we were four girls in the college class. "और बाकी लड़के थे," and the rest were boys.

"लड़कियां ही आपस में मस्ती करते थे बस," the girls would have fun among ourselves. "पढ़ने जाते थे स्कूल ऑफ इकोनॉमिक्स तो भी लड़कियों के साथ जाते," when going to study at School of Economics, we'd go with girls. "किसी के घर जाना है तो भी लड़कियों से ही हमारा संबंध रहता था," if we had to go to someone's house, our connection remained with the girls.

"हां, नोट्स वगैरह बनाने हो, कोई बात पूछनी हो तो लड़कों से बात कर लेते थे," yes, if notes had to be made or something had to be asked, we'd talk with the boys. "और मैं सब ग्रुप लीडर रहती थी," and I was always group leader. "तो लड़कियां डरती नहीं थी," so the girls wouldn't fear. "तो मैं तो डरती रहती लड़कों से," but I myself remained cautious around boys.

## **NCC: The "Do or Die" Spirit**

One of the most important experiences in college was NCC. "सेकंड ईयर में मेरे पास एनसीसी भी थी," in second year I also had NCC. "फर्स्ट ईयर सेकंड ईयर थर्ड ईयर एनसीसी थी," first year, second year, third year I had NCC.

"तो इनकी लड़ाई 62 में हुई थी," the war with China happened in 62\. "तो मेरे को राइफल ट्रेनिंग दी," so they gave me rifle training. "पहले तो एक घंटा मार्च कराते थे," before that they'd have us march for an hour. "और एक 10 ग्राम की और एक बंदिया करते थे," and they'd give 10 grams of butter and a roll. "10 ग्राम ऑफ बटर रोल बन," 10 grams of butter, a roll or bun. "बेसिकली वो देते थे हमें," basically they would give us that.

"और हम यूनिफार्म पहना करते थे," and we would wear a uniform. "एनसीसी पेंट और ऊपर शर्ट," NCC pants and a shirt on top. "और एक घंटा एनसीसी करते थे," and we'd do NCC for an hour. "मार्च पास करते थे," we'd practice marching.

"और उस फिर जब चीन की लड़ाई हुई 62 में तो 63 में हमको उन्होंने राइफल ट्रेनिंग दी," and then when China's war happened in 62, in 63 they gave us rifle training. "कंधे पर राइफल को रख के इधर सीधे कंधे पे और निशाना लगाना कि कहां जाएगा?" shoulder the rifle, keep it straight on the shoulder, and take aim—where will it go?

"शी टू फायर रियल राइफल इन हर एनसीसी," she fired real rifles in her NCC. "नेशनल कैडेट कार्ड विज़ इक्वल टू द रिज़र्व इन यू एस," National Cadet Corps, which is equal to the Reserves in the US, my grandchildren explain for context.

"पर उसका कोई उपयोग नहीं हुआ," but it never got used. "बस हम सीख के रह गए," we just learned and that was it. "सो शी डिड नॉट फाइट अ रियल वॉर," I didn't fight a real war. "एंड वेंट फॉर एक्टिव ड्यूटी एज़ अ रिज़र्व इट नेवर हैपन," and go for active duty as a reserve—it never happened.

But something more important remained. "पर जो एक मेन बात हम वहां सीखे 'डू एंड डाई' वो अभी भी चल रही है हमारे दिमाग में," but the one main thing we learned there—"Do and Die"—that's still running in my mind. Even now, at 81, that spirit of determination never left me.

We also did other activities. "और एमसी की है," and I did the musical stick exercise. "बस इतना है ना एक लकड़ी का डंडा होता है," it's like a wooden stick. "उसमें एक चेन होती है," it has a chain. "और उसमें वो बजने वाले लगे रहते गोलगोल," and on it bells are attached. "वो जब चलाओ तो वो आवाज करते हैं झनझन," when you move it, they make a jingling sound. "मतलब बजते हैं घुंघरू जैसे बजते हैं," like ghungroos ringing. "ऐसे बजते हैं," they ring like that.

"वो मैं ग्रुप लीडर हुआ करती थी उसमें," for that I was group leader. "सबको सिखाती थी," I would teach everyone. "मैं भी ले जा तक," I would also do it myself. "सो ऑन ईच एंड ऑफ द स्टिक देयर वास यू कैन से फ्यू बीड्स विच कुड मेक नॉइज़," on each end of the stick there were beads which could make noise. "एंड देन शी टू प्ले विद स्टिक इन सच वे दैट यू नो मेक गुड म्यूज़िक," and then I would play with the stick in such a way to make good music.

## **Sports and Building a Steel Body**

"और फिर नाइंथ इलेवथ में थ्रोबॉल खेलते थे," and in ninth and eleventh we played throwball. Let me explain what throwball was. "दूर बॉल चली गई," the ball would go far. "फिर झंडिया होती," then there were flags. "झंडिया होती थी कि इनको छूते हुए आप वापस अब आओ," flags were there that you had to touch while coming back.

"जैसे यहां से बेसे दूर जितने में वो बॉल लाए उतने में आप चक्कर लगा के आ जाओ," like from here, as far as they bring the ball, in that much time you run around. "और झंडी मतलब जगह जगह की इनको टच करो इनको टच करो," and the flags—you touch them at various spots.

My grandson asks if someone threw the ball at me. "हां वहां से फेंका और हमने हिट किया उसको," yes, from there they threw it and I hit it. "या सो इट वास लाइक अ क्रिकेट," it was like cricket. "एंड देन वंस द बॉल गोज़ अवे आफ्टर हिटिंग," and once the ball goes away after hitting. "सो देयर वास अ थ्रोअर ऑफ़ द बॉल एंड देन देयर वास अ बैट्समैन," so there was a thrower of the ball and a batsman. "एंड देन द बैट्समैन जस्ट लाइक इन बेसबॉल व्हेन यू थ्रो द बॉल अवे," and the batsman just like in baseball when you throw the ball away.

"सो बेसिकली इट वास थ्रोबॉल इज़ नथिंग बट बेसबॉल," so basically throwball is nothing but baseball. "शी हैड शी प्लेड बेसबॉल," I played baseball. "लेट्स पुट दैट इट वास अ रियल बेसबॉल बाय द वे," it was real baseball, by the way.

"हां बॉल आई तो बॉल को हिट किया और वो दूर गई," yes, when the ball came I hit it and it went far. "फिर सब जगह छू के," then touching all the places. "पांच छह जगह चार जगह जो भी होती थी उनको छू के वापस अपनी जगह आ गए," five-six places, four places, whatever there were, touching them and coming back to my place.

"ओ तो वो बेसेस कहते हैं," oh, those are called bases, my grandchildren explain. In those days "बेसेस नहीं बोलते थे," we didn't call them bases. "ओ ओके आज बेस बेसेस कहते हैं दादी," oh okay, today they're called bases.

"हां हमें तो अच्छा लगता था खेलते थे हम," yes, we liked it, we used to play.

We did other physical activities too. "लाठी भी चलाई है," I also practiced with the lathi (staff). "वो जो लाठी होती है ना ऐसे ऐसे चलाते हैं," the lathi—you move it like this. "ऐसे चलाते लाठी लकड़ी होती है," moving the lathi—it was wood. "इतनी बड़ी उसको भी हाथ में ले ऐसे चलवाते थे," this big, holding it in hand, they'd have us move it.

"ड्रिल पीरियड होता था," there was a drill period. "ड्रिल करते थे हम लोग," we'd do drill. "आठवीं तक ड्रिल," until eighth standard, drill.

In elementary school, "हम थ्रोबॉल खेलते थे," we played throwball. "कबड्डी खेलते थे और गुल्ली डंडा खेलते थे," we played kabaddi and gilli danda.

All of this—the walking, the sports, the NCC, the physical training—"मतलब सॉलिड बॉडी बना ली थी," I built a solid body.

"मैं ससुराल में आती थी तो मैं कहती थी स्टैंड और स्टील की बॉडी बनाई बना के दी है," when I came to my in-laws' house I would say they've built and given me a body of steel. "कितना भी काम कर लो अपन को कोई बीमारी नहीं कुछ नहीं," any amount of work, no illness, nothing.

"बस सर्दी से बीमारी ब्रोंकाइटिस आती थी," only from cold, bronchitis would come. This happened later. "कभी यहां जा रहे हैं बच्चों के काम के लिए। कभी बाहर जा रहे हैं। कभी अंदर आ रहे हैं," sometimes going here for children's work, sometimes going outside, sometimes coming inside. "तब मेरे जीवन में ब्रोंकाइटिस की बीमारी आई," then bronchitis came in my life. "बाकी कोई बीमारी भी नहीं आई," otherwise no other illness came.

## **Marriage and the Choice (1967)**

After completing college, I kept insisting I wanted to study more. My marriage finally happened in 1967\. "67 में हमारी मैरिज हुई," in 67 my marriage happened. "एंड मीन टाइम गर्ल्स एजुकेशन देने सो ड पार्टेड बिट बिकॉज़," and in the meantime girls' education was not so supported. But "नाना जी नाना जी ग्रेट नाना जी ही गव हर परमिशन एंड फील्ड टू स्टडी यस," great-Nana Ji—he gave his permission and allowed me to study.

By the time I married, "तब मैं एमए फर्स्ट ईयर कर चुकी थी," I had completed MA first year. "मैंने एमए फर्स्ट ईयर मेरठ यूनिवर्सिटी से किया है," I did MA first year from Meerut University.

"फिर मेरठ यूनिवर्सिटी और आगरा यूनिवर्सिटी अलग हो गई दोनों," then Meerut University and Agra University separated. "तो मैंने आगरा यूनिवर्सिटी से फाइनल किया एमए फाइनल," so I did the final, MA final, from Agra University. "शादी के बाद किया 68 में," I did it after marriage, in 68\. "यहां से जाके दिल्ली जाकर पढ़ाई पढ़ाई तो मतलब प्राइवेट कर ली," going from here to Delhi, studying—I did it privately. "और वहां जाके एग्ज़ाम दे दिया," and going there gave the exam. "और मुझे डिग्री जो मिली है वो आगरा यूनिवर्सिटी की मिली हुई है," and the degree I received is from Agra University.

My husband worked in Union Bank of India. "इसके पापा मैनेजर हो गए थे," he became a manager. His career progressed steadily. "पहले क्लर्क से नौकरी स्टार्ट की तुम्हारे बाबा ने," your grandfather started his job as a clerk. "फिर क्लर्क के बाद सुपरवाइजर हुए," after clerk he became supervisor. "फिर स्पेशल असिस्टेंट हुए," then special assistant. "फिर ऑफिसर हुए," then officer. "फिर मैनेजर हुए," then manager.

"मैनेजर बन गए थे तो इसलिए हमको बैंक की तरफ से मिला करता था मकान," because he became manager, we would get a house from the bank's side. That's how we got housing in all the cities where we lived.

## **Teaching: My First Job (1968)**

"मैंने नौकरी भी की थी," I also did a job. "जुलाई से और दिसंबर तक," from July to December. "फिर यह फरवरी में पैदा हुए हैं," then he (my first son) was born in February. "तो जुलाई से दिसंबर जनवरी तक मैंने नौकरी की है," so from July to December-January I did the job.

"वो पढ़ाती थी मैथ्स बच्चों को," I taught mathematics to children. "अर्थमेटिक ज्योमेट्री और अलजेब्रा," arithmetic, geometry, and algebra. "कौन सी कौन सी राधे आठवीं क्लास तक बच्चों को," to which children—to eighth standard children. "ज्योमेट्री अलजेब्रा और अर्थमेटिक तीनों सब्जेक्ट पढ़ाती थी," geometry, algebra, and arithmetic—all three subjects I taught.

"सर्टिफिकेट भी है इसका मेरा कि यह अच्छा पढ़ाती हूं," I also have a certificate of this that I teach well. "बिना देखे कुछ किताब खोली और पढ़ा दिया," without looking, without opening the book, I would just teach. "कभी मैं पढ़ के नहीं पढ़ती थी," I never taught by reading first. "मेरा मैथ बहुत अच्छा था," my math was very good.

The salary initially was low. "पैसे बहुत कम देते मुझे ₹15 देते थे," they gave me very little money, ₹15. "जब मैं नहीं हुए थे पैदा," when he (my son) wasn't born yet. "और स्कूल में पढ़ाती थी तो मुझे लगा कि मेहनत ज्यादा कर रहे हैं," and when I taught in school, I felt I was doing more hard work. "और यह हमें पैसे कम दे रहे हैं," and they're giving us less money. "बीएड वालों को ज्यादा दे रहे हैं," they were giving more to B.Ed. holders. "तो मैंने फिर बीएड किया," so then I did B.Ed.

## **B.Ed. and More Teaching (1970-71)**

After my first son was born in February 1969, when he was about two and a half years old, "तब मैंने बीएड किया," I did B.Ed. The degree says 1971, "शायद 71 में किया है," probably I did it in 71\.

B.Ed. was challenging. "इनको घर छोड़ के," leaving him at home. "एक पराई स्कूल में," one Parai school. "एक कॉलेज में," one college. "एक हॉस्टल में," one hostel. "एक घर में," one at home. "ऐसे रात में हॉस्टल में सोना पड़ता था," at night I had to sleep at the hostel. "यह छोटे थे," he was small.

"एक दिन जिद कर ली इन्होंने," one day he insisted. "कि मम्मी को लेके ही जाऊंगा मैं हॉस्टल," that I'll take Mummy to the hostel. "वार्डन कहे भाई तुम यहां रह जाओ," the warden said, brother, you stay here. "मैं नहीं रहूंगा," he said I won't stay. "मम्मी को छोड़ जाओ," leave Mummy. "मैं नहीं छोडूंगा," I won't leave her. "लेके ही आए," he brought me along. "उन्होंने कहा तुम घर जाओ बच्चा तुम्हारा साथ जाएगा," they said you go home, the child will go with you. "एक दिन जिद की थी इन्होंने हॉस्टल में," one day he insisted like this at the hostel.

Sometimes "मेरी बहन के पास रह जाते थे। मौसी के पास," he'd stay with my sister, with his Mausi.

After B.Ed., my salary improved. "आफ्टर बीएड ₹50 देते थे," after B.Ed. they gave ₹50. The school was "ललवानी," Lalwani. "ललवानी स्कूल जोधपुर," Lalwani School in Jodhpur.

## **The Journey Through Cities: Following the Bank**

My husband's job took us to many cities. After marriage in 1967, "तो पापा जोधपुर में पैदा हुए थे," Papa was born in Jodhpur. We lived there from 1967 to 1973\. "67 से 73," from 67 to 73\. That's six years. "तो 67 से लेके 73 तक," from 67 to 73\.

"जोधपुर सरदारपुर जाते थे हम," in Jodhpur we went to Sardarpur. "सरदारपुर बी रोड," Sardarpur B Road. "तो बी रोड या ए रोड निकाला उसमें बी रोड," B Road or A Road—in that area, B Road. We lived in "शिवनिवास में रहते थे शिवनिवास," we lived in Shivniwas.

"बंगला था वहां भी," there was a bungalow there too. "बैंक से मिला हुआ था," it was provided by the bank. My husband "मैनेजर हो गए थे मतलब मैनेजर थे," had become manager.

In Jodhpur, "सर्विसेज की और दोनों बच्चों को पाला पोशा," I did service and raised both children. "मतलब तुम्हारे पापा और तुम्हारे चाचा की को की परवरिश करी," raised your Papa and your uncle—took care of them.

Our second son was also born in Jodhpur. "चाचा भी जोधपुर में हुए थे बनू चाचा," uncle was also born in Jodhpur, Bannu uncle. "वो भी जोधपुर में हुए," he was also born in Jodhpur. This was in 1973\.

Then we moved to Kota from 1973 to 1975\. "कोटा में दो साल," in Kota for two years. "और भू चाचा कोटा में हुए," and Bhū uncle was born in Kota. "यहां फिर हम ट्रांसफर होके कोटा चले गए थे," then we transferred to Kota. "तो भू चाचा कोटा में हुए थे 74 बर्थ है 74," so Bhū uncle was born in Kota, his birth is in 74\.

In Kota, "शॉपिंग सेंटर में रहते थे मुफ्तलाल की दुकान है नीचे और ऊपर हमारा मकान था," we lived in Shopping Center, Muftlal's shop below and our house above. "शॉपिंग सेंटर गुमानपुर के पास पड़ता है," Shopping Center is near Ghumanpura.

All three children went to "सेंट पॉल्स स्कूल," St. Paul's School in Kota.

After Kota, we moved to Ajmer. "कोटा के बाद अजमेर गए," after Kota we went to Ajmer. This was 1975, and we stayed "छह महीने साल ऐसे ही रहे," about six months to a year.

In Ajmer, "राजा साइकिल बंगला था वहां भी," we had a bungalow near Raja Cycle. "राजा साइकिल में," at Raja Cycle. "मार्टिन ब्रिज पे होके जाते थे," going via Martin Bridge. We lived "मार्टिन ब्रिज से उतरने के बाद," after getting down from Martin Bridge, in that area near Raja Cycle.

"बंगला था वहां भी," there was a bungalow there too. "बड़ा घर था हमारा," it was a big house. "चौक था," it had a courtyard. The children went to "सेंट एन्सेल्म," St. Anselm's school.

Then Udaipur from 1976 to 1981\. "उदयपुर 75, 76 के आसपास गए होंगे," we went to Udaipur around 75-76. "पांच साल रहे उदयपुर में," we lived in Udaipur for five years.

In Udaipur, first we lived on "रेजिडेंसी रोड," Residency Road. "उसके बाद हमने," after that we moved. "रेजिडेंसी रोड से भट्ट जी की बाड़ी में चले गए थे," from Residency Road we went to Bhatt Ji Ki Badi. "वो भी कोई आधा किलोमीटर पे होगा," that was also about half a kilometer away. "ज्यादा दूर नहीं था," not very far.

In Udaipur, all three sons studied at St. Paul's School in "सरदारपुर नाम था जगह का नाम," Sardarpur was the area name, "भोपालपुर में है," it's in Bhopalpur.

Throughout all these moves, my purpose remained constant. "मेरे तो कैसे अपने को आगे बढ़ाएं बच्चों को कैसे बढ़ाएं यही था," how to advance ourselves, how to advance the children—this was my focus.

My Economics education had shaped this thinking. "हमने यू एस ए का डेवलपमेंट रशिया का जापान का इंग्लैंड का सारे डेवलपमेंट पढ़े थे," we had studied USA's development, Russia's, Japan's, England's—all development. "चार मतलब यह कंट्रीज़ के," four countries. "और अपना India जो था डेवलपिंग कंट्री था," and our India was a developing country. "इट डेवलपिंग कंट्री इनहेबिटेड बाय मतलब रिसोर्सेज़ जो थे वो रिच था," it was a developing country inhabited by—the resources were rich. "इट रिच इन रिसोर्सेज़ एंड इनहेबिटेड बाय पुअर्स," it was rich in resources and inhabited by poors. "एंड डेवलपिंग कंट्री एंड इट कैन डेवलप कैन स्क्रूटनाइज़ द नेचुरल रिसोर्सेज़ एंड देन वी आल्सो डेवलप," and developing country and it can develop, can scrutinize the natural resources and then we also develop.

"यह दिमाग में था बस," this was in my mind. "मेरे तो कैसे अपने को आगे बढ़ाएं बच्चों को कैसे बढ़ाएं यही था," how to advance ourselves, how to advance the children—this was it.

## **Coming to Jaipur: Finding Our Permanent Home (1981)**

Finally, in 1981, we came to Jaipur. "जयपुर 81 में आए जयपुर," in 81 we came to Jaipur. When we arrived, "हमारे पापा यहां आए तो हम सेवथं में पढ़ते थे," our Papa came here when he was in seventh. "और थर्ड में शायद बनू चाचा थे," and Bannu uncle was probably in third. "और फर्स्ट में भू चाचा थे," and Bhū uncle was in first.

Initially we lived "खासा कोठी के पीछे रहते थे," behind Khasa Kothi. "वो जो कौन सी जगह कहलाती है वहां," that area. "खासा कोठी के पीछे," behind Khasa Kothi. This was near the railway station area.

But there was a problem. "पहले इससे पहले हम स्टेशन के पास रहते थे," before this current house, we lived near the station. The landlord "खाली कराना चाहता था," wanted to vacate us. "मैंने कहा मैं ऐसे मकान में नहीं रहूंगी। दूसरा लेलो," I said I won't live in such a house. Take another one. "वो बैंक से लिया हुआ था," it was taken by the bank. It was "लुंबा का मकान," Lumba's house.

"तो ठीक थे। वो हमें उसमें ही एडजस्ट करा गए," so okay, they adjusted us in that one. "लुंबा का मकान। मैंने कहा मैं नहीं रहूंगी। इसमें," Lumba's house—I said I won't live in this. "फिर जब यह नहीं चाहता मकान मालिक तो मैं क्यों रहूं," then if the owner doesn't want us, why should I stay? "हमने फिर अपना खाली कराया पैसे दे के यह वाला मकान का," we then got this current house vacated by paying money. "हम इसमें आ गए," we moved into this one.

That was in 1981\. "यह घर जब इस घर में आए तो तुम्हारा पापा सेवथं में पढ़ते थे," when we came to this house, your Papa was in seventh. "चाचा थर्ड में थे," uncle was in third. "और छोटे चाचा फर्स्ट में पढ़ते थे," and younger uncle was in first.

"सितंबर अक्टूबर में आ गए थे यहां पे या दिसंबर मतलब एंड में आए थे इस साल के," we came in September-October or in December, at the end of the year. "एंड में आए थे हम," we came at the end.

And we've been here ever since. "अब तक अभी 42 इयर्स," until now 42 years. "42 सालों में यहां," 42 years here. From 1981 to 2023—this became our permanent home.

## **The Choice: Work or Family**

Once settled in Jaipur, I had to make a clear choice about how I would spend my life. When we came to Jaipur, the principal of Seedling School approached me. "जब हम दिल्ली में आ गए तब मैंने सीडलिंग स्कूल की जो प्रिंसिपल थी," when we came to Delhi—actually, when we came to Jaipur—the principal of Seedling School. "उसने मुझ से कहा कि तुम हमारे घर हमारे स्कूल में पढ़ाने आ जाओ," she told me, come teach at our school. "वो हायर सेकेंडरी स्कूल था," it was a higher secondary school.

"मैंने कहा मैं नहीं आ सकती," I said I can't come. "तुम ने घर में थी," I had children at home. "तो मैंने बैच में पढ़ाती थी टेबल पर बैठ के," so I would teach in batches, sitting at the table at home.

"मेरे हाथ के बच्चे बहुत अच्छे निकले," children taught by my hands turned out very well. "पास होते हैं," they would pass. "उनकी मां अभी तक मेरे से मिलती है," their mothers still meet me until today. "जयपुर की बात है," this is from Jaipur time.

My reasoning for not working outside was clear. "मैं सोचती थी अगर नौकरी करती तो दो काम करने पड़ते," I thought if I did a job, I'd have to do two works. "नौकरी भी करो, घर का काम भी करो," do the job, and also do household work. "अब एक ही काम करना पड़ रहा है सर," now only one work needs to be done. "बस घर का काम करो," just do household work.

I accepted the trade-offs. "नहीं हुआ डेवलपमेंट कोई बात नहीं," if development didn't happen, no problem. "हॉबीज़ पूरी नहीं हुई," hobbies weren't fully completed. "जो एक जिस चीज़ के लिए स्ट्रगल किया कि यह करूंगी वो नहीं कर पाई," what I struggled for—that I would do this—I couldn't do that. "यह सब किस्मत है मेरी," this is all my fate.

But I understood my purpose. "मैं सबकी कर्ज़दार थी," I was indebted to everyone. "जो मैं चुकाती रही," which I kept repaying. "सारे लोन कि भाई इनकी सेवा करो," all the loans—serve them, brother.

Let me explain who "them" was. "भाई मेरे तीन बच्चे हैं," brother, I have three children. "चौथे पति है," fourth is husband. "पांचवी में हूं," fifth is myself. "इन्हीं का काम जो है वो मेरे लिए वर्क है," their work is my work. "वही वर्क इज़ वरशिप है," that work IS worship. "यह सब भगवान के जीव हैं," these are all God's beings.

But it wasn't just my three sons. "शुरू से मैं इनके बहन भाई में रही हूं," from the beginning I lived among his siblings. "बस एक साल अकेली रही," only one year I lived alone. "तब अपना घर बसाया," that time I set up the house. "थोड़ा जरूरी सामान मतलब नीड्स का," a little necessary stuff, the needs. "और उसके बाद नेसेसिटी बसाने के बाद," and after setting up necessities. "इनकी दो बहनें और एक भाई," his two sisters and one brother. "मतलब इनकी तुम्हारे पापा की बुआ दो बुआ एक चाचा आ गए," meaning your Papa's two buas (father's sisters) and one chacha (father's brother) came.

"तो उनके पांच आदमियों का काम हो गया," so five people's work became mine. "फिर पापा पैदा हुए तो उनका काम हो गया," then when Papa was born, his work was added. "बस घर का ही काम करती रही मैंने," I just kept doing household work.

"हमारे बाबा के चाचा और बुआओं की शादी," our grandfather's chacha and buas' weddings. "और सबकी पढ़ाइयां," and everyone's education. "और सबकी नौकरियां," and everyone's jobs. "मैंने उनमें सहयोग किया है," I helped with all of these.

"कभी मना नहीं किया कि नहीं करूंगी मैं यह काम," I never refused saying I won't do this work. "मैं कहती हूं जो पुण्य का काम हो रहा है," I say whatever virtuous work is happening. "मैं पाप की भागी क्यों बनूं मना करके?" why should I become party to sin by refusing? "करो भाई," do it, brother. "हम आ रही हूं," I'm coming. "लेके वो डिग्रियों का अपना," taking those degrees of mine—despite having my degrees, I chose this path.

## **Never Stopping: A Lifetime of Learning**

What I want you to understand is that I never stopped learning. Even while raising children, managing a household, and often housing extended family, I kept taking courses, kept growing, kept adding skills.

In 1978, while we were in Udaipur, I took a food preservation course. "उदयपुर सरदार किया," in Udaipur I did it. "78 में फूड प्रिजर्वेशन का," in 78, food preservation. "उसमें टॉफी बनानी, जेली बनानी, जैम बनाना, कैंडी बनानी, स्क्वैशेस और सिरप्स यह सब सीखा," in that, making toffee, making jelly, making jam, making candy, squashes and syrups—I learned all this.

The moment we came to Jaipur in 1981, "हमने कुकरी बेकरी का कोर्स किया," we did a cookery baking course. "खासा कोठी में गवर्नमेंट ऑफ इंडिया चलाती थी," in Khasa Kothi, Government of India ran it. "तब मैंने किया," then I did it. "कुकरी बेकरी एक महीने का कोर्स था," cookery bakery was a one month course. "अल्टरनेट डेज़ पे क्लास होती थी," classes happened on alternate days. "वन मंथ कोर्स कुकरी बेकरी," one month course, cookery bakery. "पिज़्ज़ा है, केक है," pizza, cakes—bakery items.

Then in 1987, "87 में वो कटिंग का कोर्स करा," in 87 I did the cutting course. "या क्या किया?" or what did I do? "आपने बोला कि 1987 में कटिंग का कोर्स किया," you said in 1987 cutting course. My grandchildren are helping me remember.

"87 में कटिंग के का कोर्स किया," in 87 I did cutting and tailoring course. "कटिंग टेलरिंग," cutting tailoring. "उसमें क्या होता है?" what happens in that? "कपड़ों का काटना और सी काट के सिलना उसको," cutting cloth and sewing what you've cut. "मतलब जैसे जांगिया सिलना, बनियाने सिलनी," meaning like sewing underwear, sewing vests. "फिर उसके बाद फ्रॉक वगैरह बनाने, ब्लाउज बनाने, सलवार कमीज़ बनाने, नाइट सूट बनाने, पेंट बनाने, कमीज़ बनानी बच्चों की," then after that making frocks, making blouses, making salwar kameez, making nightsuits, making pants, making children's shirts. "यह सब सीखा। छह महीने का कोर्स," I learned all this. Six month course. "87 में किया," did it in 87\.

I also joined the Kitchen Gardening Association. "कि चन गार्डनिंग एसोसिएशन जॉइन किया," I joined the Kitchen Gardening Association. "वहां पे यह बागवानी का काम सीखा," there I learned this gardening work. "और वो कौन सी एसोसिएशन?" which association? "कि चन गार्डनिंग एसोसिएशन," Kitchen Gardening Association. "टैंक रोड पर," on Tank Road. "कई प्राइस दिए उसने," it gave several prizes. "गार्डनिंग छोटा सा है," the gardening area was small. "उसी ने लगा ले," that one set it up. Now "अभी हैव ेदांग इस पे फोन पे नहीं," my nephew runs it. "हॉस्टल चला रहा है मेरा भांजा," my nephew is running a hostel. "चंद्रशेखर क्लीनिक चला रहा है," Chandrashekhar is running a clinic. "तुम्हारे पापा का मौसी का लड़का," your Papa's Mausi's son.

Then there was astrology. "फिर उसके बाद फिर मैंने ज्योतिष का कोर्स किया," then after that I did an astrology course. "तेरे दादा करने लगे तो मैंने भी उनके साथ-साथ ज्योतिष का कोर्स कर लिया," your grandfather started doing it, so I also did the astrology course along with him. "एस्ट्रोलॉजी एस्ट्रोलॉजी," astrology. "कौन सी साल में?" which year? "अब वो तो देखना पड़ेगा। जो सर्टिफिकेट मिले हैं मुझे याद नहीं है," now I'd have to check—the certificates that I got, I don't remember. "पर हां काफी साल हो गए उन बातों को," but yes, many years have passed since those things. Later I remember—"मैंने ज्योतिष का कोर्स 2001 में किया है," I did the astrology course in 2001\. "चलो जी। चेन्नई से," okay, from Chennai.

My music education continued too. After marriage I kept learning. "भी है यहां आने के बाद भी सीखा," I also learned after coming here (to Jaipur). "गोयंका के," from Goyan का. "उसने कहा मैं बेशत करा दूंगी सेकंड ईयर का एग्ज़ाम दे दिया थर्ड ईयर की बुक खरीद ली," she said I'll definitely get you through—I gave the second year exam, bought the third year book. But then "तुम्हारे पापा के चाचा गुज़र गए," your Papa's chacha passed away. "जवान मौत थी 41 साल के थे," it was a young death, he was 41 years old.

"तो मैंने छोड़ दिया कि लोग कहेंगे लहंगा वाना बजाती है," so I stopped because people would say she's playing music. "यह तो जवान देवर मरा है," this when her young brother-in-law has died. "इसलिए मैंने खुद ने ही छोड़ दिया," so I myself stopped.

I had started learning music way back in 1954\. "वो तो हमने सन 54 से सीखना शुरू कर दिया था," we started learning from 1954\. "तबला और हारमोनियम," tabla and harmonium. "फिर हम दिल्ली आए तो वहां सेकंड ईयर का एग्ज़ाम भी दिया," then we came to Delhi and gave the second year exam. "इलाहाबाद यूनिवर्सिटी से," from Allahabad University. "प्रयाग यूनिवर्सिटी," Prayag University.

And even first aid, long ago. "मैंने फर्स्ट एड का कोर्स भी किया," I also did a first aid course. "दिल्ली में किया है," I did it in Delhi. "जब सन 59 या 59 की बात होगी," when—it must be from 59\. "हमारे पूरे सर्टिफिकेट हैं सेंट एंबुलेंस से," we have complete certificates from St. Ambulance. "इसका फर्स्ट एड का भी किया," of this, first aid also done.

I even taught what I learned. "जोधपुर से वो बता दिए ना," from Jodhpur, told you that. "सारे वो तो कर ही चुके हैं," all those we've already done. "बताना है तो ज्योतिष का," what remains to tell is astrology. And "महाराजा स्कूल में एक महीना फूड प्रिजर्वेशन का कोर्स भी सिखाया," at Maharaja School, one month I also taught a food preservation course. "सिखाया ओ," taught it, oh yes.

All my certificates, my daughter-in-law Kokila organized them. "वो भी हैं क्या बोलते हैं सर्किट हाउस," there's also what they call—oh, all these certificates. "पूरी बेकरी का तो 81 में ही किया है," complete bakery I did in 81\. "और 87 में वो कटिंग का कोर्स करा," and in 87 that cutting course.

At age 61, I was still taking courses. Can you imagine? Never stopped learning, never stopped growing.

## **The Three Principles My Mother Taught Me**

Of all the education I received, the most fundamental came from my mother. "हमारी मां कहती थी," our mother used to say. "मतलब इनकी नानी," meaning their grandmother. "तुम्हारे पापा की," your Papa's grandmother.

She taught three things: "चोरी मत करो," don't steal. "झूठ मत बोलो," don't lie. "किसी की जी मत जीभ को मत दुखाओ," don't hurt anyone with your tongue, don't hurt anyone with words.

"यही भगवान की सेवा है," this itself is serving God. "और वही धर्म मैंने पालन किया," and that same dharma I followed. "कि भाई मेरे तीन बच्चे हैं चौथे पति है पांचवी में हूं," brother, I have three children, fourth is husband, fifth is myself. "इन्हीं का काम जो है वो मेरे लिए वर्क है," their work is my work. "वही वर्क इज़ वरशिप है," that work IS worship. "यह सब भगवान के जीव हैं," these are all God's beings.

I taught my children these same values. "फिर इनको सिखाया कि किसी की चीज़ चोरी नहीं करके लेनी है," then I taught them don't take anyone's thing by stealing. If they found something: "अपन को कोई भी अगर चीज़ पड़ी है तो वो भगवान की मंदिर में दे दो," if we find anything lying around, give it to God's temple. "कहीं से मिल जाए अपन को तो अपने पास मत रखो इस चीज़ को," if you get something from somewhere, don't keep that thing. "मत लो," don't take it. "अपनी मेहनत से करो," do it by your own hard work.

"तो इन्होंने यही सीखा," so they learned this. "कभी पेंसिल भी लिया है तो मैंने कहा वापस दे के आओ," even if they took a pencil, I said return it. "नहीं मैं दे के आऊंगी स्कूल में," if you don't, I'll go to school and return it. "तो यह कभी कोई चीज़ वापस लाते नहीं थे किसी की," so they never brought anything back that belonged to others. "बच्चे इनको मतलब चोरी करना सिखाया की नहीं करोगे चोरी," children—I taught them: you will not steal.

I also taught them about sharing. "इनको सिखाया कि कोई भी चीज़ खाओ तो बांट के खाओ," I taught them that whatever thing you eat, eat by sharing. "इनको सारा जैसे अंगूर लाए इनको चार तीनों को बांट दिए," like grapes—I brought them and distributed to all three. "और कहा बेटा मुझे दो थोड़े से मैं भी तो खाऊंगी," and said son, give me a couple, I also want to eat. "तो यह इनको बच्चों को यह आ गया कि भाई हमें यह चीज़ लेके बांट के खानी है," so this entered the children's minds—brother, we have to share this thing.

I taught them myself, never hired tutors. "हमने ट्यूशन नहीं लगाई एक बार भी इनको अपने घर में," we never hired tuitions even once for them at our home. "और वो भी क्या था कि मैंने ही पढ़ाती थी इन बच्चों को तीनों को," and moreover I myself taught all three children.

"हमारे पापा 12वीं में नौकरी 12वीं में ट्यूशन करने लगे," our Papa—in 12th he started giving tuitions in 12th. "जब आईआईटी करना था उनको तब उन्होंने केमिस्ट्री वगैरह की," when he had to do IIT, then he did Chemistry etc.

## **The Four Ashrams: Stages of Life**

As I've grown older, I've come to understand life through the framework of the four ashrams. "चार आश्रम होते हैं," there are four ashrams. Let me explain them:

"एक बाल आश्रम होता है," one is Bal Ashram—childhood. "गृहस्थ आश्रम होता है," Grihastha Ashram—householder stage. "एक वानप्रस्थ आश्रम होता है," one is Vanprastha Ashram—retirement stage. "और एक सन्यास आश्रम," and one Sanyas Ashram—renunciation stage.

The timing is precise: "तो यह 25 साल तक तो चलता है बाल आश्रम," Bal Ashram runs until 25 years. "25 से 50 चलता है गृहस्थ आश्रम," from 25 to 50 runs Grihastha Ashram. "50 के बाद 75 तक चलता है वानप्रस्थ आश्रम," after 50 until 75 runs Vanprastha Ashram. "और उसके बाद चलता है 75 के बाद सन्यास आश्रम," and after that runs, after 75, Sanyas Ashram.

"तो अब मैं सन्यास आश्रम में आ गई," so now I've entered Sanyas Ashram. What does this mean? "तो मुझे दुनिया से को छोड़ना है," I must leave worldly attachments. "मतलब धीरे-धीरे कटिंग करनी है हर चीज़ की," meaning gradually cut off from everything. "और भगवान में लगना है," and engage in God.

"बस मेरा यही उद्देश्य है," this is my only goal. "कि जो आश्रम मैंने गुज़ारा उसको मैं अच्छी तरह गुज़ारूं," whatever ashram I'm passing through, I should pass through it properly.

Looking back: "बाल आश्रम में बचपन की चीज़ें," in Bal Ashram, childhood things. "गृहस्थ आश्रम में गृहस्थ की सारी चीज़ें," in Grihastha Ashram, all household things. "बाप में तुम्हारे पापा की शादीवादी और अपनी ज़िम्मेवारियों से निपटने का सारा काम," also your Papa's wedding and all responsibilities, all that work. "जैसे तुम लोग पैदा हुए तो तुम्हारा बर्थडे मनाना," like when you all were born, celebrating your birthdays. "बाल उतरवाना," mundan ceremony. "सारे काम करना जो भी मतलब बच्चे के लिए होते हैं," all work that happens for children.

Now in Sanyas Ashram: "अब मेरा सन्यास आश्रम है तो मैं अब ज्यादा तामझाम पसंद नहीं करती," now I'm in Sanyas Ashram so I don't like too much pomp and show. "शादी में जाना पसंद नहीं करती," I don't like going to weddings. "अकेले में रहना पसंद करती हूं," I prefer to stay alone. "जिस से मेरी जो रोज़ाना का काम है," so that my daily routine work—I can focus on that.

## **My Daily Spiritual Practice at 81**

Let me tell you about my routine now. Every morning at 7 AM, I go to the temple. "7:00 बजे आरती होती है," the aarti happens at 7:00. There are three aartis I attend:

"एक तो होती है शिव जी की आरती राम के 7:00 बजे," first is Shiv Ji's aarti, Ram's, at 7:00. "दूसरी होती है ओम जय जगदीश हरे राम कृष्ण लक्ष्मण सीता हनुमान जी की और राधा गोविंद की," second is Om Jai Jagdish Hare for Ram, Krishna, Laxman, Sita, Hanuman Ji and Radha Govind. "तीसरी होती है गणेश जी की," third is for Ganesh Ji.

"तीनों आरती करके प्रसाद ले के वहां से मैं फिर घर आती हूं," after all three aartis, taking prasad, I then come home.

After returning home, I have my writing practice. "रोज़ दो पेज लिखती हूं," I write two pages daily. What do I write? "जय श्री कृष्णा," Jai Shri Krishna, over and over.

Let me explain my system: "छह कॉलम बने हुए हैं पेज में," six columns are made on the page. "एक कॉलम में 37 नाम आते हैं," one column has 37 names. "छह एक कॉलम में 37 नाम तो छह कॉलम में 222 नाम आ जाते हैं उनमें," so six columns have 222 names total.

Now, "16 की दो मालाएं पूरे हो जाती है 108 108," two malas of 108 complete. "तो दो मालाएं तो रोज़ चार माला रोज़ लिखती हूं," so two malas—daily four malas I write. "दो पेज में चार माला," two pages equal four malas. "रोज़ लिखना मेरा काम है," writing daily is my work.

I've filled half a notebook already. "यह देखो यह कॉपी है जय श्री कृष्णा," look, this is the notebook, Jai Shri Krishna. "और इसमें मैंने आधा भर लिया यहां तक," and in this I've filled half up to here. "यह मैंने लिख लिया 10 तारीख तक का," I've written this up to the 10th. "सुबह उठ के रोज़ लिखूंगी," waking up in the morning I'll write daily. "जितनी मेरे में ताकत है या टाइम है," as much as my strength or time allows. "दोनों एडजस्ट कर," adjusting both.

But I have a special system. "फिर यह आज यह 11 तारीख का है," then this today is for the 11th. "10 तारीख का कंप्लीट हो चुका है," the 10th is complete. "अब 11 का लिखूंगी," now I'll write for the 11th. "यह दो पेज एडवांस में लिख के रखूंगी," these two pages I'll write in advance.

Why? "कि भाई 11 को अगर मान लो नहीं लिख सकी जैसे मैं हॉस्पिटल पहुंच गई," because if on the 11th, suppose I can't write, like if I reach the hospital. "तो तीन तारीख को मैं हॉस्पिटल गई थी," on the third I went to hospital. "तो मेरा तीन का लिखा हुआ था," but my third's writing was already done. "आने के बाद चार पांच छह," after coming back, four, five, six. "पांच को तो मैं आ गई," on the fifth I came back. "तो चार का लिखा पांच का लिखा छह का लिखा," so I wrote for the fourth, wrote for the fifth, wrote for the sixth. "फिर ऐसे कर कर के एडवांस कर करके अब एडवांस में पहुंच गई लिख लिख के," doing like this, advancing, now I've reached ahead by writing.

"और इस से मुझे बहुत अच्छी शांति मिली है," and from this I've received very good peace. "लिख के," through this writing.

I also read Gita regularly. "बस गीता पढ़ती हूं," I just read Gita. "गीता से मुझे ज्ञान मिलता है," from Gita I receive knowledge. "कि कैसे अपन को जीवन जीना है?" how should I live life? "कैसे दूसरों से समझना है," how to understand others. "कि भाई यह प्राणी क्या है?" what are these beings? "यह मतलब यह प्रकृति क्या है?" what is this nature? "पेड़ पौधे पशु पक्षी इंसान क्यों बने कैसे बने भगवान ने यह सारे," trees, plants, animals, birds, humans—why did God make all these, how were they made?

Recently I've been attending Shiv Puran discourses. "अभी हमारे मंदिर में शिव पुराण होगा," now in our temple there will be Shiv Puran. "30 तारीख से 9 तारीख तक चलेगा," it will run from the 30th to the 9th. I already attended one: "एक बार शिव पुराण 20 30 दिसंबर तक सुन चुकी," I listened to one Shiv Puran until 30 December. "24 नवम्बर से और 30 नवम्बर तक सुन चुकी," from 24 November to 30 November I listened.

These teach about creation and how to live. "उसमें यही सब बताते सृष्टि क्या है," in them they explain what is creation. "और अपन को कैसे रहना है," and how should we live.

The texts describe different yugas: "थोड़ा सा यह फर्क हो गया है सतयुग में चीज़ें अलग थी," there's been a bit of difference—in Satya Yuga things were different. "सतयुग के बाद त्रेता हुआ उसमें अलग हुई," after Satya Yuga came Treta, different there. "द्वापर में अलग हुई," in Dwapara it was different. "और अब यह कलयुग है," and now this is Kaliyuga. "तो वो वाली चीज़ें यहां फिट नहीं बैठती है," so those things don't fit here.

"लेकिन जहां तक वो उन चीज़ों का जो सार है जो उद्देश्य है जो लक्ष्य है उसको पकड़े रखो," but whatever is the essence, the purpose, the goal—hold onto that. "चाहे वो कलयुगी हिसाब से मतलब लो स्ट से पूरी हो रही है," even if you interpret it according to Kaliyuga, even if it's fulfilled in a diluted way. "लेकिन अपन को लक्ष्य पे पहुंचना है," but we must reach the goal. "लक्ष्य में," the goal.

## **The Philosophy of Karma**

From Gita, I learned about the consequences of our actions. "गीता कहती है कि अगर सात्विक कर्म किए तो देव योनि मिलेगी," Gita says if you do satvik actions, you'll get divine birth. "और अगर राजस कर्म किए तो मनुष्य योनि मिलेगी," and if you do rajasic actions, you'll get human birth. "और अगर आपने तामसी कर्म किए तो कीट पतंगा नीची वाली योनियां मिलेगी," and if you do tamasic actions, you'll get insect, moth, lower births.

"खुशी दोगे तो खुशी लोगे," give happiness, get happiness. "अच्छा किसी का करोगे सुख दोगे तो सुख लोगे," do good for someone, give comfort, you'll get comfort. "दुःख दोगे तो दुःख लोगे," give sorrow, get sorrow. "कैसी अगर गलत बातें करोगे," if you do wrong things.

But here's the important part: "फिर मरने के बाद यह चीज़ें 10 गुना ज्यादा होकर मिलती है," after death, these things return 10 times over. "जैसे एक किसी का चोर लिया तो आपको ₹10 चुकाने पड़ेंगे मरने के बाद," like if you steal one rupee from someone, you'll have to pay ₹10 after death.

Why this happens relates to what goes with you after death. "मन अपना शरीर नहीं जाएगा साथ में," the physical body won't go with you. "यह स्थूल शरीर यही रह जाएगा," this gross body will stay here. "सूक्ष्म शरीर जाएगा," the subtle body will go. With it goes: "मन, चित्त, अंग और बुद्धि और इंद्रियों के पांचों कर्म," mind, consciousness, aspects, intellect, and the five actions of the senses. "सुनना," like hearing. "यह इंद्रियों की जो जो कर्म है वो सारे साथ जाएंगे," all these sensory karmas go with you. "जैसा कि गीता बताती है," as Gita explains.

"तो मैं यही सोचती हूं क्यों अपन ऐसे काम करें जिस से कि अधोग योनि में पड़े दुःख पाए," so I think why should we do such deeds that lead to lower birth and suffering? "अपन अच्छे कर्म करें जिस से अच्छी योनि में जाए," we should do good deeds so we go to good birth. "अच्छे विचार रखें बस," keep good thoughts, that's all.

Interestingly, I don't want moksha. "और मोक्ष नहीं चाहती कि भगवान के वहां जाकर बैठ जाए," I don't want moksha where I go to God and just sit there. Instead: "पुण्य करो भगवान के वहां जाओ थोड़े दिन जितने पुण्य है उतने भोगो फिर वापस आ जाओ," do good deeds, go to God's place, stay for a while enjoying the fruits of your merit, then come back. "फिर मृत्युलोक में ही जन्म लेना पड़ेगा," will have to take birth again in the mortal world.

I want to keep coming back, keep serving, keep being useful.

## **How to Deal with People**

Over the years, I've learned how to handle relationships. "और एक मैं आपको बताऊं बुराई अगर किसी की देख ली अपन ने उसको वहीं त्याग दो," if you see evil in someone, leave it right there. "और अपने मुंह मोड़ के अपना रास्ता पकड़ लो," turn your face and take your own path.

"संसार में सब तरह की चीज़ें मिलेंगी," in this world you'll find all kinds of things. "अच्छे लोग भी मिलेंगे बुरे भी मिलेंगे," good people and bad people both will be found. "घृणा किसी से मत करो," don't hate anyone. "जो वो अपने पर दोबारा वार करें," because it will strike back at you.

"शत्रु पैदा मत करो," don't create enemies. "मित्र बनाओ सबको," make everyone friends. "मनुष्य अपना ही मित्र है अपना ही शत्रु है," human is their own friend, their own enemy.

"तो जो भी लोग मिले उनको शत्रु जैसे सोचोगे अरे कहां से आ गया," if you think of people as enemies—"oh no, where did they come from?" "और मित्रवा मिल रहा अरे बड़ा अच्छा हुआ," but if you think a friend is meeting—"oh how wonderful\!" "मतलब मन में एक वो आ जाएगा प्रमाद आ जाएगा," in your mind either confusion will come or clarity.

To remove this confusion: "इसलिए इसको प्रमाद को हटाने के लिए ना तो खुश हो और ना दुःख मनाओ," to remove this confusion, neither be too happy nor sad. "सबको समान मानो," consider everyone equal. "कि और अच्छी चीज़ों को पकड़ के आगे बढ़ो," catch the good things and move forward. "उनको फेंक दो कचरे की टोकरी में," throw the bad things in the garbage basket.

When someone insults you, my mother taught: "किसी ने गाली दी तो गाली तुम्हारी नहीं हुई अगर तुम," if someone gives you an insult, it's not yours if you don't accept it. "तो हम तो गिरदान लेते ही नहीं थे कि इसने क्या कहा," we didn't even pay attention to what they said.

"पर दुःख तब होता था," but sometimes it would hurt. When it hurt, "तो अपना दुःख हल्का करने के लिए किसी को कहना पड़ता था," to lighten my sorrow I had to tell someone. "भाई ऐसा आज हुआ यह हुआ वो हुआ," brother, this happened today, that happened. "बाकी उसका समाधान नहीं हुआ," but I didn't seek solution. "तो उसको लेकर ही चलते रहे," just kept moving forward with it.

My action was measured: "और दूर कर दिया कि उस आदमी से दूर रहो जिस से कम से कम सुनना पड़े," decided to stay away from that person so I hear minimum from them. "पर उसको जवाब नहीं दिया," but didn't give them a reply. Didn't retaliate. "क्योंकि वो हमारे साथ एडजस्ट नहीं हो सकता," because they can't adjust with us. "अलग रहे हमारे मतलब विचारों से," they're different from our thoughts.

"तो ऐसे करके अपनी ज़िंदगी मैंने तो निकाली है," this is how I led my life. I didn't gossip. "और जहां मुझे मौका मिला गपशप नहीं करती थी मैं," wherever I got opportunity, I didn't gossip.

## **The Debt Philosophy**

Now in my old age, my thinking has evolved further. "अब मेरे दिमाग में यह चीज़ आ गई," now this has come to my mind. "किसी की सेवा नहीं लेनी," don't take anyone's service. "चाहे बेटा भी हो," even if it's your own son. "उसका भी करके चलो," do his work yourself too. "जिस से उसका ऋण अपने ऊपर नहीं चढ़े," so his debt doesn't accumulate on me.

"जीव का जीव ऋण चढ़ता है," one being becomes indebted to another being. "मैंने तुम्हारा काम किया तुमने मेरा किया बराबर हो गया," I did your work, you did mine, we're equal. "तुम तुम करते रहोगे तो मैं तुम्हारी कर्ज़दार हो जाऊंगी सेवा की," if you keep doing for me, I become indebted for the service.

"इसलिए मेरा दिमाग अब ऐसा हो गया है," therefore my mind has become like this.

That's why even now, at 81, I do everything myself. "मैं स्वास्थ स्वास्थता और सफाई और धरा उठाई इनसे अभी तक भी समझौता नहीं कर पाई," health, cleanliness, and organizing—I still haven't been able to compromise on these. "मैं अपने हाथों से सुबह सुबह सफाई वगैरह करती हूं," I do cleaning with my own hands every morning. "स्वास्थ हज़ीन का मतलब पूरा ध्यान रखती हूं," I pay complete attention to hygiene.

"मुझे डस्टबीन तक साफ चाहिए," even the dustbin must be clean. "मुझे ऐसा नहीं है कि उसमें भी कीटाणु पैदा हो जाए," I don't want germs breeding even in that. "जर्म्स अगर खराब है तो उसको धोना," if there are bad germs, wash it. "और उससे भी साफ नहीं हो तो साबुन लगा के स्क्रबर से रगड़ के धो देना," and if still not clean, then apply soap and scrub with scrubber and wash. "मतलब कहने का सफाई यह काम," meaning, this is the work of cleanliness.

"फिर बाल्टियां वगैरह साफ चाहिए मग साफ चाहिए," then buckets must be clean, mugs must be clean. "नहाती हूं तो बाल्टी और मग को धो के साबुन से फिर नहाती हूं," when I bathe, I wash the bucket and mug with soap, then bathe. "चाहे कोई भी नहाया हो पानी उस पानी से नहीं नहाती," even if anyone else bathed, I don't bathe in that water. "नल से निकाल के ही नहाती हूं," I bathe only in water taken from the tap. "खाली कर लेती हूं बाल्टी को और फिर," empty the bucket first, then...

This is my way. I can't change it now. I don't want to change it.

## **The Health Crisis (January 2023\)**

This January, something happened that could have been the end. "तीन तारीख को मैं हॉस्पिटल गई थी," on the third I went to hospital. My sugar level had dropped dangerously. "उन्होंने फौरन 31 शुगर लेवल पहुंच गया," they immediately—the sugar level reached 31\.

My granddaughter Somya's reaction showed how serious it was. "सोम्या मैं हॉस्पिटल जाने लगी। दोनों रोने लग गए," Somya—when I was leaving for hospital, both started crying. "सोम्या भी कि दादी को क्या हो गया? दादी को क्या हो गया?" Somya too saying, "What happened to Dadi? What happened to Dadi?"

But Bhavya acted fast. "भवू इमीडिएटली मेरे को ले गया," Bhavya immediately took me. "अगर पांच मिनट भी देर हो जाती तो पता नहीं क्या होता," if even five minutes delay had happened, who knows what would have happened. "डॉक्टर ने जैसा कि कहा," as the doctor said. Those five minutes could have meant everything.

I was in hospital from the third and "पांच को तो मैं आ गई," on the fifth I came back.

The doctor gave me new orders. "डॉक्टर ने कहा दो-दो घंटे से खाओ," doctor said eat every two hours. "तो मैं दो-दो घंटे से खाने लग गई," so I started eating every two hours. "भाई काम छोड़ो पहले खाने में लगो," brother, leave work, first focus on eating. "कुछ भी खाओ नारियल पानी पियो वर्क करो," eat anything, drink coconut water, then work. "तो मेरे को यही चीज़ें पसंद है," so these are the things I like now.

"अब तुम लोगों की सबकी दुआएं काम कर गई," now all of you people's prayers worked. "जी रही है," I'm living.

## **The Steel Body at 81**

Looking back at my physical journey, I can say with pride: I built a steel body. All those childhood activities—walking to school, carrying water, playing sports, doing NCC drills, rifle training, throwball, the physical discipline—everything combined to build strength.

"मैं ससुराल में आती थी तो मैं कहती थी स्टैंड और स्टील की बॉडी बनाई बना के दी है," when I came to my in-laws' house I would say they've built and given me a body of steel. "कितना भी काम कर लो अपन को कोई बीमारी नहीं कुछ नहीं," any amount of work, no illness, nothing.

The only exception was bronchitis from temperature changes. "बस सर्दी से बीमारी ब्रोंकाइटिस आती थी," only from cold, bronchitis would come. This happened when "कभी यहां जा रहे हैं बच्चों के काम के लिए। कभी बाहर जा रहे हैं। कभी अंदर आ रहे हैं," sometimes going here for children's work, sometimes going outside, sometimes coming inside. "तब मेरे जीवन में ब्रोंकाइटिस की बीमारी आई," then bronchitis came in my life. "बाकी कोई बीमारी भी नहीं आई," otherwise no other illness came.

At 81, doctors confirm what my childhood habits built. "जिस डॉक्टर ने अभी इलाज किया 81 80 इयर्स ओल्ड में उम्र में तो उसने बताया आपके दांत बहुत मजबूत है," the doctor who recently treated me at 80-81 years said your teeth are very strong. The sugarcane habit paid off.

My eyes, from that sadhu's teaching: "उससे मेरी आंखें बिल्कुल ठीक है। मतलब नसें वगैरह मेरी काफी ठीक है जैसा कि सर्जन ने बताया," from that my eyes are completely fine—my nerves etc. are very good as the surgeon explained. "दिखाती रहती हूं यहां पे इस उम्र में भी 81 साल की उम्र है। तो उस समय भी ठीक है मेरी," I keep showing them regularly even at this age of 81—back then also they were fine.

## **Connecting Across Generations**

Here I am, at 81, talking to my grandchildren via video call. They're showing me things I never imagined as a child. "वर्चुअल रियलिटी," Virtual Reality, they explain. "नहीं मैंने नहीं देखा," no, I haven't seen this. "अब देखा अब देख रही हूं मैं तो," now I'm seeing it, now I'm looking at it. They explain this new technology, and "अच्छा," I say—I see.

They show me their artwork. "बहुत बढ़िया," very good. They're studying computer science, data science, entrepreneurship. "बहुत बढ़िया बात," very good thing. "सफलता के मार्ग पर चल रहे हो," you're walking on the path of success. "डेवलपिंग स्किल है अच्छी बात," developing skills is a good thing. "कोई ना कोई हॉबी डेवलप करते रहो," keep developing some hobby or other.

They use Google Maps to find my old addresses. "यह है दादी यह है दरीबा कलान रोड," this is it, this is Dariba Kalan Road. They show me Ramjas College: "हां ऐसा ऐसा था," yes, it was like that. "यस इट इज़ द सेम बिल्डिंग," yes, it's the same building. Looking at St. Paul's School in Kota: "हां ऐसा ही था," yes, it was like this.

It's 1 PM. "हां 1 PM है तो आप लंच खाओ अभी," yes, it's 1 PM, you eat lunch now. "से मिलने जाऊंगी अभी तो," I'll go meet someone now. Multiple "बाय बाय बाय" as we end the call.

## **My Life's Essence**

"मेरा तो अब यह जो जीवन है वो ऐसा चल रहा है," my life now is proceeding like this. Looking back over 81 years, what do I see?

I see a girl who walked miles to school with a cloth bag on her shoulder. I see a young woman who fought for education when it wasn't encouraged. "हम तो पढ़ेंगे," I will study, I insisted. And I did—through BA Honours, MA, B.Ed., and decades of additional courses into my sixties.

I see someone who learned early that when water is needed, you carry it yourself. That when your body needs care, you give it that care—washing eyes with water-filled mouth, chewing sugarcane for strong teeth, walking and playing for strength. That steel body still serves me at 81\.

I see a woman who learned from NCC: "डू एंड डाई"—Do or Die. That spirit, "वो अभी भी चल रही है हमारे दिमाग में," it's still running in my mind. When obstacles come, you don't quit. You persist.

I see someone who made a choice: two works or one? Family service or career? I chose family, but I elevated it. "इन्हीं का काम जो है वो मेरे लिए वर्क है," their work is my work. "वही वर्क इज़ वरशिप है," that work IS worship. "यह सब भगवान के जीव हैं," these are all God's beings.

I see someone who never stopped learning. Food preservation at 38, cookery and bakery at 41, cutting and tailoring at 47, astrology at 61\. "और इस से मुझे बहुत अच्छी शांति मिली है," and from this I've received very good peace.

I see someone who passed on three principles from my mother: "चोरी मत करो, झूठ मत बोलो, किसी की जी मत जीभ को मत दुखाओ," don't steal, don't lie, don't hurt with words. "यही भगवान की सेवा है," this itself is serving God.

I see someone who learned to deal with people wisely: "शत्रु पैदा मत करो, मित्र बनाओ सबको," don't create enemies, make everyone friends. "उनको फेंक दो कचरे की टोकरी में," throw bad things in the garbage basket. "मनुष्य अपना ही मित्र है अपना ही शत्रु है," human is their own friend, their own enemy.

I see someone who understood the four ashrams and now, at 81, lives in Sanyas: "तो मुझे दुनिया से को छोड़ना है। धीरे-धीरे कटिंग करनी है हर चीज़ की और भगवान में लगना है," I must leave worldly attachments, gradually cut from everything and engage in God.

Every morning at 7 AM, three aartis. Then home to write "जय श्री कृष्णा" two pages, four malas, in neat columns. Reading Gita. Attending Puran discourses. "और इस से मुझे बहुत अच्छी शांति मिली है," and from this I've received very good peace.

From pre-Independence railway bungalow with lamp-lit nights and carried water, through the struggle for education, through marriage and raising three sons while often housing extended family, through moves across Rajasthan cities, through decades of continuous learning, through teaching generations without hired tutors, through maintaining standards that never compromise—this has been my journey.

"बस मेरा यही उद्देश्य है कि जो आश्रम मैंने गुज़ारा उसको मैं अच्छी तरह गुज़ारूं," my goal is whatever ashram I'm passing through, I pass through it properly. Childhood properly. Householder stage properly. Retirement stage properly. Now Sanyas stage properly.

"अच्छे विचार रखें बस," keep good thoughts, that's all.

When the health crisis came—sugar level at 31—"अगर पांच मिनट भी देर हो जाती तो पता नहीं क्या होता," if even five minutes delay had happened, who knows. But "अब तुम लोगों की सबकी दुआएं काम कर गई," everyone's prayers worked. "जी रही है," I'm living.

The "Do or Die" spirit from age 19 still drives me at 81\. The steel body built in childhood still serves. The three principles from my mother still guide. The karma philosophy from Gita still motivates. The ashram framework still structures. The daily spiritual practice brings peace.

"मेरा तो अब यह जो जीवन है वो ऐसा चल रहा है," my life now is proceeding like this.

And I'm grateful for every single day.

**जय श्री कृष्णा** 🙏
