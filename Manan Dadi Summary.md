# **Memories with Dadi \- A Comprehensive Summary**

## **Her Presence & Essence**

### **Physical Memories**

* **Her appearance**: Sky blue was her favorite color \- the color of the sky. She wore it often throughout her life, in different celebrations and events. The photo used for her memorial website shows her in sky blue with flowers in her sari \- that's how you picture her.  
* **Her movements**: As she aged, her walk changed to more of a waddle, using a cane. You remember the sound of her footsteps, the way she moved through spaces.  
* **Her hands**: Soft but experienced \- hands that had rolled thousands of rotis, washed dishes, and done housework throughout her lifetime.  
* **Her scent**: Jasmine or rose \- the smell you associate with India.  
* **Her voice**: Present in the video recordings you have of her.

### **Her Personality**

* **Fierce determination**: She put 100% effort into everything she did. This wasn't just about being a grandmother \- she was a woman who fought hard to continue her education when it wasn't encouraged, who juggled MA and B.Ed after marriage and children.  
* **Action over words**: She showed love through actions, not explicit affection. She wasn't much of a hugger, didn't say "I love you" frequently, but expressed care through serving rotis, making food, and constant service.  
* **Selfless yet independent**: A fascinating contradiction \- she would serve everyone else first, eat last, do the dishes after everyone finished, yet fiercely insisted on doing everything herself to maintain her self-sufficiency and health.  
* **Strict about order**: She would get angry if something was out of place or not done properly.  
* **Playful with grandchildren**: She was lenient and playful about cards and making time for her grandkids \- that was always important to her.  
* **People-focused**: She thrived in big family environments and struggled with the quietness of weekdays in Sunnyvale when everyone was working. She was used to constant company in India.

## **Food & Kitchen Memories**

### **What She Made**

* **Roti sabji**: The main dish, made again and again. You can picture her hands rolling rotis on the belen, even on the ground in Jaipur.  
* **Saak (shakar bare)**: Her favorite thing to make.  
* **Namkeen and nashta**: Morning snacks that smelled amazing \- full of spices and different aromas.  
* **The cooking process**: She was always composed in the kitchen, knew how to move around, parallel process, manage multiple things at once.

### **Meal Rituals**

* **Her role at meals**: She would sit anywhere but would always be making rotis throughout the entire meal, continuously serving everyone at the table. She'd eat last, sometimes after everyone had finished.  
* **The importance of sitting together**: This was very important to her \- everyone eating together as a family.  
* **Chai times**: During chai time, there would be different snacks, bohre, nashta from the Indian market. On weekdays in Sunnyvale it was just your immediate family, but weekends were filled with people visiting.

### **Food Values She Taught**

* **Never waste food**: Not a single drop (boond) of dal, not a grain of rice, not any vegetables. She emphasized how food comes from farmers to the table, how lucky you are not to have to farm it yourselves.  
* **Share food**: Food was always made for everyone, meant to be shared. This created an environment of a shared home and family experience.

## **The Summer of 2024 \- Three Precious Months**

### **In Sunnyvale (May-July 2024\)**

**Daily rhythm**: You had a precious window from 5pm to 8:30pm each day to spend with her (after your work, before she went to bed).

**Activities together**:

* **Google Maps on the projector**: In the garage, showing her different places around the world. Her amazement: "I can't believe from here we can travel the world from sitting at home."  
* **Taking her to Michael's**: Getting yarn for knitting projects. It was wonderful for her to see arts and crafts and do creative work that wasn't a priority in Jaipur.  
* **She knitted items**: Including a sweater for Samya.

**Walking her through your education**:

* **Elementary school**: Showed her where you grew up, different classes, the playground, book fairs.  
* **Middle school**: Showed her the building from outside, talked about different subjects.  
* **High school**: Got to go inside, showed her robotics room, the Olympic pool where you swam for years, the large gymnasium, the amphitheater where you and friends hung out.  
* **UC Berkeley**: The most detailed tour \- shared stories of midterm exams, professors, clubs, activities, dorms, meal culture. You immersed her in your four-year experience there.

**Her reaction**: Pure pride. She was really happy and smiled seeing the college campus and pool. This was incredibly meaningful given her own struggles for education.

**The parallel moment**: In India, she had walked you through all her certificates \- BA in Economics, cookery/baking certificates. You have video of this. She wanted you to see how intelligent she was, how good she was at math. Then you walked her through your educational spaces. Both of you sharing your educational journeys with each other.

**Walking on Albatross Drive**: In 2024, she would make four rounds back and forth outside your house in the neighborhood because Ortega Park was too far. This was different from 2013 when she was younger and could walk to Ortega Park and back by herself.

**Pinecrest Lake trip (around July 4th)**:

* The family trip with drone show  
* **Stargazing moment**: You were all in the patio area. Her saying "Wow, there's so many stars in the sky."  
* This was one of her last trips to the US.

**Her wanting to return to India**: She kept saying she wanted to go back to India soon, as soon as possible. Your family convinced her to stay until your 21st birthday \- that was meaningful to have her there for that milestone. She stayed from May through July.

**Your 21st birthday**: Amazing celebration with both sides of the family coming together in San Ramon and Sunnyvale. She switched between staying with you and staying with Binu Chacha in San Ramon for a week, getting to spend time with both sons.

**The goodbye in late July**: She left with Nidhi auntie around July 25th. It was hard because you didn't know if you'd see her again. But you did \- you visited India in early 2025\.

**Your reflection on this time**: "I won't need to be living with regret" \- you consciously made time for her, carved out evenings and weekends even while working that summer. This is something you'll cherish forever.

## **India Visits**

### **Jaipur \- The Daily Rhythm**

* **Morning**: She would do puja and prayers, then nasta  
* **Throughout the day**: Chai, spending time together  
* **Card games**: Playing cards with her, Dada, and other grandkids  
* **Walking to temple**: A five-minute walk where you'd walk slowly to keep up with her pace. The street was full of cars. At the temple, she'd show you around different idols, then you'd sit and watch her do puja and prayers during arti. Sometimes in comfortable silence, sometimes asking her about things.

### **The 2018 India Trip (You were in middle/high school)**

**Places visited**:

* **Jantar Mantar**: The old clock tower area. You remember it being super hot \- 110 degrees. She described and showed you different things.  
* **Nahargarh Fort**: One of the popular forts. She enjoyed walking around, exploring, seeing animals.  
* **Dada's property**: Visiting the plot of land he owned, seeing houses being built. Riding in the Maruti Suzuki car. Witnessing his real estate development work and work ethic.  
* **Temple visits**: Seeing different idols and statues with Dadi.

**Family time**:

* **51st anniversary celebration**: Dadi and Dada's anniversary. Everyone sat down for photos \- such a treasure now. You took lots of selfies with Dadi (your first phone from middle/high school). Cutting cake together, celebrating them.  
* **Big family meals**: Around 10 people in the house for lunches and dinners. Eating chole bhature, roti sabji, puri, raita. Always tons of good food.  
* **Eating mangoes**: Sitting at the dining table in the main area of the Jaipur home, any time of day (morning or evening), just eating mangoes together. It was fun and sweet.  
* **Time with Samya**: Your younger cousin was 3-4 years old then, still a toddler. Dadi spending time with her.

### **The Final Visit \- Early 2025**

* This was the last time you saw her.  
* Saying goodbye in Jaipur: "Achha sero, make sure you live well."  
* You kept WhatsApp calling and video calling after.  
* Her death came suddenly and unexpectedly \- you thought it was wrong medicine. You still don't know exactly why or how it happened.

## **Playing Cards \- Bridging Generations**

### **The Games**

* **Rummy** (her favorite, though she'd get a bit annoyed sometimes, especially when you made fast moves)  
* **Uno**  
* Various other card games

### **The Setting**

* **In Sunnyvale**: Playing as a family when she visited  
* **In India**: Playing with her, Dada, and other grandkids \- bringing all generations together

### **Her Demeanor**

* Happy when playing  
* Sometimes a bit competitive/annoyed in Rummy  
* Would laugh and have fun  
* Would say things like "Oh, I got it"  
* Her laughter was contagious \- everybody loved it when she was really happy

### **What It Meant**

"Having activities that bridge the generations is very important" \- this was your way of connecting across generational divides, bringing laughter, enjoyment, and happiness to everyone.

## **Her Spiritual Life \- The Sanyas Ashram Stage**

### **Daily Practices in Her Later Years**

* **Writing "Jai Shri Krishna"**: Every single morning, two pages \= four malas. She filled entire notebooks with this practice. The notebook is back in India now. She was incredibly disciplined and consistent about this, both in Sunnyvale and in India. You can picture her sitting there writing those pages.  
* **Reading the Gita**: For knowledge about how to live life, how to understand different beings, nature, why things exist.  
* **Going to temple**: 7am daily for arti in Jaipur. Three different artis \- Shiv ji, Ram/Krishna/Lakshman/Sita/Hanuman/Radha Govind, and Ganesh ji. She'd do all three, take prasad, then come home.  
* **Attending religious events**: Listening to Shiv Puran and other teachings about creation, how to live life.

### **Her Philosophy**

She talked about the **four ashrams** (stages of life):

1. **Bal ashram** (0-25): Childhood/student life  
2. **Grihasth ashram** (25-50): Householder life  
3. **Vanprasth ashram** (50-75): Gradual withdrawal  
4. **Sanyas ashram** (75+): Spiritual focus, detachment

At 81, she was in sanyas ashram. This meant:

* Cutting ties with worldly things  
* Not wanting to attend marriages  
* Preferring to be alone to focus on her spiritual practices  
* Not wanting elaborate celebrations  
* Focusing on eventual moksha (liberation)

### **Her Beliefs**

* **Karma**: "If you give happiness, you'll receive happiness. If you give sorrow, you'll receive sorrow." After death, things come back 10 times stronger.  
* **Good deeds for good rebirth**: Satvik karma leads to dev yoni (divine birth), rajasik karma to human birth, tamasik karma to lower births.  
* **Don't create enemies**: Don't hate anyone. Every person is their own friend or enemy.  
* **Accept both good and bad**: Don't be overly happy or sad, treat everything equally.  
* **Let go of others' faults**: If you see someone's bad behavior, turn away and take your own path.

### **Your Reflection**

Her spiritual devotion kept her rooted and grounded. Her faith allowed her to live longer. These practices were really important parts of living long and being grounded and doing your part in the world.

## **Values & Lessons She Taught**

### **About Food & Resources**

* Never steal \- even if you find something, don't take it  
* Share everything \- if you get grapes, divide them among everyone  
* Never waste food \- respect every grain because of the farmers' work

### **About Education**

* "Aage badho, aage badho" (move forward, progress)  
* Her emphasis on education came from her own struggles \- she had to fight her family to continue studying  
* She wanted you to have a bigger, better future  
* She taught that education and knowledge were incredibly valuable

### **About Work & Service**

* Put 100% into everything you do  
* Do your work with your own hands \- washing dishes, doing housework kept her healthy  
* She emphasized: "How to raise the standard of living, how to develop the house full of facilities"  
* Her goal was always to help her children and grandchildren progress

### **About Respect & Relationships**

* Always listen to and respect your elders  
* What elders say, they've thought through carefully  
* Don't hurt anyone with your tongue/words  
* Mutual respect is essential even when relationships aren't perfect

### **About Independence**

* She didn't want anyone's service  
* Didn't want to be a burden to her children  
* Wanted to stay self-sufficient as long as possible  
* Saw housework as keeping her physically and mentally healthy

## **Weekend Gatherings in Sunnyvale**

Since she was people-focused and struggled with quiet weekdays, you made weekends special:

**Activities**:

* Birthday and anniversary celebrations  
* Trips to San Ramon (handoffs between sons' houses)  
* Going to Ortega Park for walks  
* Playing cards  
* Visits with family friends in San Jose, Pleasanton, and Fremont  
* Full house with people coming over  
* Talking, sharing laughter, memories, food, and chai

**The Atmosphere**: "Big family environments when everyone's all together it's always so much fun and that's always the best which happens on the weekends."

## **The Changes You Witnessed (2013 → 2024\)**

### **The 11-Year Gap**

Most vivid memories are from 2024 when you were an adult. Some childhood memories from 2013\. You also visited India in 2018 when you were in middle/high school.

### **Physical Changes**

* **2013**: She could walk to Ortega Park and back by herself \- Sunnyvale was safe  
* **2024**: Could only do four rounds on Albatross Drive \- the park was too far  
* Became more frail over time  
* Needed more help sitting down and getting up  
* Required more assistance from children and grandchildren

### **Her Adjustment to America**

* **Independence lost**: In India she could walk herself places, meet other grandparents. In the US, she needed someone to drive her everywhere, was somewhat stuck at home.  
* **Different lifestyle**: In India, there were maids and helpers. In the US, you do everything yourself \- dishes, housework, manage your own household.  
* **Quieter environment**: Used to constant company in the joint family structure (three generations). The US was much quieter, especially on weekdays.  
* **Joint family vs. nuclear family**: The concept of three generations in one household is more Indian; the American lifestyle is different.

## **The Complexity of Her Life**

### **Unfulfilled Ambitions**

* She had dreams of architecture and real estate  
* Dada didn't support her pursuing her career  
* She gave up her career ambitions to help the family progress and raise children  
* She lived with regret about not pursuing her career more  
* She wondered "how my life could have turned out" if she'd been able to pursue her career  
* But she was really happy with how her children and grandchildren turned out

### **Household Tensions in Jaipur**

* Life wasn't easy in the Jaipur home  
* Arguments between Dadi and Dada about purchases, chores, household management  
* "Why did you buy this?" "How come this wasn't done?"  
* Three generations living together created complexity  
* Dadi managed the entire household essentially on her own  
* She pulled it all together despite having no real choice \- no one else would do it  
* The weight of all those responsibilities was on her shoulders

### **Your Dad's Experience**

* He grew up in a harder, more tumultuous environment compared to your mom's side  
* Your nani and nana (maternal grandparents) had "the perfect home, perfect relationship, perfect everything"  
* This generational difference affected how your parents were raised

### **Your Wish**

* You wish Dada had taken some time off from work  
* You wish they could have spent good quality time together  
* You don't know when the last time that was, or if you witnessed it

### **Your Reflection**

They saw so much in their lifetime \- World War II, Partition, tumultuous events, but also the growth of children moving to the US, grandchildren going to college in America, India growing from developing to developed nation. It was a different lifestyle, different historical context. You know this is how things work, even if you're processing how it shapes how you want to live your own life.

## **Her Relationship with Other Family Members**

### **With Samya (your cousin)**

* Special relationship because Samya was born in Jaipur and lived with Dadi  
* They grew up together \- the grandchild growing up with the grandmother  
* You always made sure to tell Samya to take care of Dadi and do her best  
* This made the loss especially hard for Samya

### **With You**

* You prioritized time with her when she was in the US  
* You're proud of how you prioritized time with grandparents  
* You made conscious effort to spend quality time \- "I did really well and I did, I'm proud of myself"

### **With Your Other Cousins**

* The relationship was affected by tensions between the brothers (your dad and uncles)  
* Competitiveness between brothers created distance  
* Some cousins didn't talk as much to Dadi or make as much effort  
* When Dadi visited for 3 months, you're not sure how much time some family members actually spent with her  
* The family dynamics overshadowed some relationships

### **With Your Mom**

* A little bit harder relationship  
* Tension about career ambitions \- Dadi thought your mom should give up ambitions to raise children (like Dadi did)  
* Your mom has many ambitions and you wanted her to succeed  
* After losing her own parents, it took your mom 3-4 years to find herself again  
* Dadi also pressured about marriage timing for you  
* They didn't have a perfect relationship, but they had mutual respect

## **Final Reflections**

### **On This Process**

"Being the best grandkid is just wanting to know about the best of our grandparents and really capture all their memories and all their life's work."

You actively lived this through:

* The interview you conducted 3 years ago  
* The videos you recorded  
* Walking her through your schools  
* Making time during that summer of 2024  
* Being present with her

### **On Her Passing**

* It was sudden and unexpected  
* You were still video calling regularly  
* You thought it was wrong medicine  
* You still don't know exactly why or how it happened  
* The suddenness makes it harder

### **On Grief**

You're grieving:

* The loss of her presence  
* The unfairness of her life \- ambitions she couldn't pursue  
* The weight she carried managing an entire household  
* The time she and Dada didn't get to enjoy together  
* But also celebrating: the time you did have, the memories you captured, the fact that you won't live with regret

### **What Brings Peace**

"I won't need to be living with regret" \- you consciously made the effort to spend time with her, to show her your life, to capture her stories, to be present. This brings you peace now that she's gone.

---

This is the story of your Dadi \- a woman who fought for education, sacrificed her career dreams for family, served everyone tirelessly, maintained fierce independence, filled notebooks with spiritual devotion, loved sky blue and parrots and mangoes, taught you not to waste a single grain of rice, and whose legacy lives on in your success and in the values you carry forward. A complicated, determined, loving, fierce woman who shaped your family's trajectory through her sacrifices and her unwavering belief in education and progress.
